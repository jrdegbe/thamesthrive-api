This plugin allows users to inject one of the previous events from the current profile into the payload. It takes any payload as input and returns event data on port **found** if the event was found, or input payload on port **not_found** if the event was not found. The configuration for this plugin includes two parameters: Event type and Offset. Event type is the type of event to be loaded into the payload, while Offset is an offset from the current event. For example, 0 will return the current event, -1 will return the previous one, and so on. Additionally, the plugin also has advanced configuration options, which are written in JSON format. This includes the same parameters as the basic configuration, but allows for more detailed customization.
