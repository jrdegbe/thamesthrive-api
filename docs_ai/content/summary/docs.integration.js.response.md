Event response in ThamesThrive is a data structure that is sent back from the server after processing an event. This response typically includes information about the current profile ID and may also contain additional data based on the configurations and logic defined within workflows. The response is structured in JSON format and contains various keys and values. ThamesThrive provides the flexibility to configure response data within each event type workflow, allowing you to define the data that should be included in the response generated by that particular workflow. 

The event response can be captured using the window.onThamesThriveReady event and accessed through the context.response object. This allows you to dynamically change the page content based on the data returned from ThamesThrive workflows. You can also bind events to page elements by binding the function to the window.onThamesThriveReady property. This will run on every page after the events are triggered. 

ThamesThrive helpers can be used to bind events to page elements. For example, you can use the helpers.onClick method to bind an onClick event to a button and the helpers.track method to send a custom event to ThamesThrive at any time.
