This documentation text provides information about the importance of synchronizing the profile.id returned in response
with the profile id saved on the client side. It explains that if the profile in response is different from the one
sent, the client should update its profile.id and send a new one with the next call. If this step is missed, the
profile.id will be recreated with each call to the /track API, which could ruin the profile. The text also emphasizes
the importance of this step by stating that it is very important.
