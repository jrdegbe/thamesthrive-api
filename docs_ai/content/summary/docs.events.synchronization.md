Profile synchronization is an important tool for managing customer data in systems that process large volumes of events
and actions related to individual profiles. By coordinating the processing of events and actions, organizations can
ensure that data is accurate, consistent, and up-to-date, and that actions and processes are performed in the correct
order.

ThamesThrive is an example of a customer data platform that uses profile synchronization to ensure that events related to
different customer profiles are processed sequentially, even if they are sent at the same time. This ensures that the
data for each customer is accurate and up-to-date, and that actions and processes are performed in the correct order.
For example, if two messages need to be sent and the second message depends on the result of the first one, the system
must wait for the first event to be finished before sending the second message. Without profile synchronization, it is
possible that events for different customer profiles could be processed out of order, leading to inconsistencies and
errors in the data.
