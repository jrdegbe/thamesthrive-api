This plugin is designed to publish payload to RabbitMQ. It requires configuration, which includes the source, name, id, queue name, routing key, queue type, compression, auto declare, and serializer. The input payload is read and sent to the queue, and there is no output. The RabbitMQ must be defined as a resource in ThamesThrive. This plugin is useful for sending payloads to RabbitMQ for further processing.
