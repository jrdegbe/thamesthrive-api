This documentation provides information about three different errors that can occur when using the ThamesThrive tracker payload. The first error is a 422 Unprocessed entity error, which occurs when the tracker payload is missing some data. This usually happens when a required field is missing. The second error is an Unauthorized error, which occurs when the source.id that is sent with the payload does not exist in ThamesThrive. The third response is a header, which returns the amount of time it took to process the request. This header is called the x-process-time header. All of this information is important to know when using the ThamesThrive tracker payload, as it can help to identify and troubleshoot any errors that may occur.
