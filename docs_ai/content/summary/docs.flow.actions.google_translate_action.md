This plugin is designed to translate text from one language to another using the Google Translate API. It is based on the library googletrans, which uses the public JSON API to make the translation. The plugin requires a JSON configuration to be provided, which includes the text to be translated and the source language. The output of the plugin is a JSON schema containing the translated text. It is important to note that this plugin is experimental and may stop working due to the public JSON API not being intended for this kind of use.
