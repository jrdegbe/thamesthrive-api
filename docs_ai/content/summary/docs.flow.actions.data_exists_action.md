This plugin is used to check if data exists and is not null or empty. The user must type the path to the property to be checked. For example, if the user wants to check if `context.page.url` exists in the event, they would type `"property": "event@context.page.url"` into the plugin. This plugin does not input any payload, but it does output two possible results: True or False. If the data exists, the True port is triggered. If the data does not exist, the False port is triggered. This plugin is useful for verifying that data exists before attempting to use it.
