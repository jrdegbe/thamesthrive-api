This Salesforce Data Extension plugin allows users to create or update records in Salesforce Marketing Cloud Data Extension. In order to use the plugin, users must first create an API Integration in their Marketing Cloud account. This requires users to provide a Client ID, Client Secret, and REST Base URI. The subdomain for the REST Base URI can be found by taking the text between the brackets in the URL. Additionally, users must provide the Data Extension ID, which can be found by right-clicking on the Data Extension's name in the Audience Builder > Contact Builder section. 

The plugin takes any payload as input and returns the given payload on the success port if the action was successful, or additional error information on the error port if one occurred. The configuration for the plugin requires users to provide an ID and name for the Marketing Cloud resource, the Data Extension ID, a boolean value for updating existing records, and a mapping of columns. The mapping of columns requires users to provide the column name and the corresponding profile or event property.
