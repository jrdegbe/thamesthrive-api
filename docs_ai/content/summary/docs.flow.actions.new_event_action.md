The documentation text describes the Raise Event Action, which is a feature of the ThamesThrive platform. This action triggers a defined event type, which can be intercepted by ThamesThrive to run a defined flow. The action can also send defined event properties. In order to configure the action, the user must profile the event type and event properties that will be attached to the event and then sent to ThamesThrive. The user can also set properties from the payload, by starting with @ and giving a path (in dot notation) to the JSON data. Debugging of flows with raised events can be tricky, as the user will only see data from one flow, and not from other triggered flows. Additionally, the user must be aware of the possibility of cyclic flows, which can form a never-ending cycle if not prevented. ThamesThrive will stop sending new events when it detects a possible cyclic execution.
