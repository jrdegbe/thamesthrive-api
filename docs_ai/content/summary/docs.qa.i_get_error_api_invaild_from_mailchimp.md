If you are receiving an "API Invalid" error from Mailchimp, it is likely due to an incorrect or invalid API key. To obtain the correct API keys for Mailchimp, you will need to log in to your Mailchimp account and select "Profile" from the top-right corner. In the "Profile" section, choose "Extras" and then "API keys". To add email addresses to a Mailchimp audience, you will need the Mailchimp API key. To send one-to-one transactional emails, you will need the Mandrill API key. Once you have generated the API keys, copy the respective key and paste it into the Token field in the ThamesThrive Form or your Mailchimp integration settings in ThamesThrive.

For more information on generating, disabling, and deleting API keys in Mailchimp, you can refer to the official Mailchimp documentation. Additionally, sending one-to-one emails using Mandrill requires domain verification. You can find additional guidance on domain verification and configuring your DNS in the Mandrill Authentication and Delivery documentation. By following these instructions and ensuring the correct API key is used, you should be able to resolve the "API Invalid" error and successfully connect ThamesThrive with Mailchimp.
