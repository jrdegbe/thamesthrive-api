This documentation describes the Send to MixPanel plugin, which is used to send processed events to a given MixPanel project. The plugin requires a MixPanel account, project, and resource containing the project's token and server prefix. Service account credentials are not required for this plugin.

The plugin takes any payload as input and returns the given payload on the success port if the action was successful, or on the error port if an error occurs. The configuration for the plugin includes form fields such as the MixPanel resource, which is used to select the MixPanel resource containing the project's token and server prefix, and additional fields mapping, which allows for custom mapping for the event using dotted notation. The advanced configuration for the plugin includes a source object containing the ID and name of the MixPanel resource, and a mapping object containing custom keys and paths or values.
