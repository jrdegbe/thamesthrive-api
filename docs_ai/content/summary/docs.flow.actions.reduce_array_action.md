This plugin is designed to reduce an array of values into a set of counts and min/max values. It takes any payload as input and requires a valid dot path to the array that needs to be reduced. The output of the plugin is a reduced array on port **result**, or an error info on port **error** if one occurs. An example input is a JSON object with a list of values, and the output for this input is a JSON object with counts, max, and min values. The plugin configuration includes a form field for the path to the array, and a JSON configuration with the same path to the array.
