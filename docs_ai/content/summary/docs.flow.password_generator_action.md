This documentation is about a password generator plugin. The plugin allows users to generate passwords according to
their own specifications. The user can set up the password specification by five properties: maximum length, minimum
length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters and special characters. The plugin will then generate a password that meets
the user's criteria.
