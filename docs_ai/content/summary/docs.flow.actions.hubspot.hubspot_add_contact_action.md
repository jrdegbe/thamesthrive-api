This plugin documentation provides information about a plugin that adds new contacts to HubSpot, based on provided data. The plugin takes any payload as input and returns response from HubSpot API on port response, or error info on port error if one occurs. To connect ThamesThrive with HubSpot, a HubSpot resource must be created. The resource must have the following rights: crm.objects.contacts.write, crm.schemas.contacts.read. The plugin can be configured either with a form or with a JSON configuration. With the form, the HubSpot's resource must be selected and contact properties such as email, firstname, lastname, and phone must be typed. With the JSON configuration, the source and properties must be specified. The source includes the resource ID and name, while the properties include the contact's email, firstname, and lastname.
