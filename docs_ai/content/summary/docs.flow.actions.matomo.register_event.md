This documentation provides information on how to register an event in Matomo. It outlines the two required fields for registering an event, which are the resource and the SiteID. It also provides instructions on how to find the SiteID for a given website. To find the SiteID, the user must log into their Matomo account, go to the Administration page, click on the Measurables (or Websites) > Manage page, and find the website ID listed directly below the website name. The SiteID is an integer number, such as 1. Additionally, the documentation states that other fields are optional.
