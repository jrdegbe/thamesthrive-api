This documentation describes the "Product Details Page View" event, which should be used when a customer views a product details page on an e-commerce website. This event can be used to track customer behavior and preferences, as well as to optimize product offerings and improve the customer experience. The expected properties for this event are listed in a table, and include the product's price, quantity, SKU, ID, name, URL, brand, variant, and category. Additionally, auto indexing is used to make data easy to find by creating a structure that organizes the data. This structure is made by copying information from the different parts of the data and putting it into a specific format that can be used to analyze and group the data. Data will not be copied to profile. Finally, a JSON example and a tracker example are provided to demonstrate how to use this event.
