This plugin allows users to edit segments in Mautic. It takes any payload as input and returns the same payload on the success port if everything went OK, or some additional error info on the error port if an error occurs. The plugin configuration requires users to select a Mautic resource, containing private and public key, define an action (add or remove), type in the path to the field containing the ID of the Mautic contact, and type in the ID of the segment that they want to add or remove the given contact from. Additionally, users can configure the plugin using the advanced configuration, which requires them to provide the ID and name of their Mautic resource, the action (add or remove), the path to the ID of the contact, and the ID of the segment.
