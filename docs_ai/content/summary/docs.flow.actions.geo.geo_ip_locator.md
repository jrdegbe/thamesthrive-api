This plugin allows you to connect to geoIP servers and return the location of a customer based on the provided IP address. The JSON configuration for this plugin requires a source ID, which is a unique identifier for the GeoLite2 server credentials. The IP value can be a path to a value in the profile, payload, or event, or the IP address itself. Additionally, the resource configuration requires a license key and account ID to connect to the MaxMind GeoLite2 API. This plugin is useful for obtaining the location of customers based on their IP address.
