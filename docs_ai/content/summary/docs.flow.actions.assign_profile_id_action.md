This plugin is used to assign a given value as the current profile's id. It takes any payload as input and returns the same payload on the port "payload" without any changes. The configuration for this plugin requires a JSON object with a "value" field that contains the path to the new id. This plugin is useful for assigning a new id to a profile, allowing the profile to be identified and tracked.
