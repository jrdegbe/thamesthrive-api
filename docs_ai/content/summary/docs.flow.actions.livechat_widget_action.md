This documentation provides instructions on how to integrate the LiveChat widget into a web page. It explains that in order to do so, an account must be opened at www.livechat.com. During sign-up, a code will be presented that must be copied to the plugin form. If an account already exists, the user must log-in to the system and go to Settings, then select Channel/Website. The same code should be visible there, which must also be copied to the plugin form. The form requires the user to enter the code in the License field.
