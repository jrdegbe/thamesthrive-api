This documentation provides information about Novu, an open-source notification infrastructure for developers. It explains how to register an notification event in Novu and how to send it to users via different means of messaging, such as e-mail, SMS, and push messages. 

The documentation also explains how to obtain Novu's Apikey, which is necessary to use the Novu plugin. To get the Apikey, users must first go to the Novu website and create a profile. Then, they must go to the "Settings" tab and select the "Api Keys" tab. With the Apikey, users can then go to the "Integrations Store" tab and set up an email provider. Finally, users can create templates and edit the workflow for notifications in the "Notifications" tab. 

In the case of any issues, the documentation explains that each email provider has its own guide. To access the guide, users must click on the chosen provider and look for the "Read our guide on where to get the credentials here" link.
