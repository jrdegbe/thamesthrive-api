This plugin is designed to match particular groups of regexes that are specified in a pattern. The configuration of this node requires the user to provide a regex pattern, a text, and a group prefix. The text can be accessed using dot notation to access profile or event data. The group prefix is used to identify the groups in the output. If the regex pattern is incorrect, the plugin will not stop the workflow but will log a warning. This node does not process input payload and returns a dictionary containing the matched data with groups. An example of the output is provided in the documentation.
