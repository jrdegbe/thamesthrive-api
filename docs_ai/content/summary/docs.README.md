This documentation provides instructions for installing and testing a software package, as well as building it. The
installation process requires the user to use the pip command to install the requirements listed in the
docs/requirements.txt file. To test the software, the user must run a docker command in the ThamesThrive-api folder.
Finally, to build the software, the user must type the mkdocs build command in the same folder. This documentation
provides clear instructions for each step of the process, ensuring that the user can successfully install, test, and
build the software package.
