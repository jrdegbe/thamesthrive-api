This plugin removes a card from a given list in Trello. It takes any payload object as input and returns a response from the Trello API on the response port, or an empty payload on the error port if an error occurs. To begin working with Trello inside ThamesThrive, an API key and token are required. The API key can be retrieved by logging into Trello and visiting the app-key page. The token can be generated by clicking the token link and allowing access to the Trello account. The API key and token must then be copied into the Trello resource in ThamesThrive. The plugin form requires the URL of the Trello board, the name of the Trello list, and the name of the card. Advanced configuration requires the source ID and name, board URL, list name, list ID, and card name. If there are two lists with the same name on one board, ThamesThrive will pick one of them without a method of specifying which one will be picked. This rule also applies to the cards.
