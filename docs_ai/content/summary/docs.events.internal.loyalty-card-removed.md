It outlines the expected properties of the event, such as the id, which is a string. It also outlines the auto indexing and copy event data to profile features, which help to make data easy to find by creating a structure that organizes the data. This structure is made by copying information from the different parts of the data and putting it into a specific format that can be used to analyze and group the data. The table outlines which event property will be copied to event traits and which fields will be copied to profile fields. Finally, an example of how the event data might look in JSON format is provided.
