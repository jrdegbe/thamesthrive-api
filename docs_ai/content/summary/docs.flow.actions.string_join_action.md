This plugin is used to join a list of strings into a single string. The configuration of the plugin requires two parameters: a list of strings and a delimiter. The list of strings can be provided as a path to data in profile, event, session, etc. The delimiter is used to separate each element in the list. The output of the plugin is a single string with each element in the list separated by the delimiter. For example, if the list of strings is ['a','b','c'] and the delimiter is ',' then the output will be 'a,b,c'. This plugin does not process input.
