This plugin is designed to encode a plain text string as base64. It requires configuration, which includes providing a path to the string that needs to be transformed and setting the encoding of the input string. The node reads a property from the input payload and returns an object with the input property encoded as a base64 string. An example of the output is a JSON object with the base64 string as the value. This plugin is useful for encoding strings that need to be securely stored or transmitted.
