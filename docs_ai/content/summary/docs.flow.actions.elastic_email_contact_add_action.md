This plugin allows users to add a contact to their Elastic Email account. It takes any payload as input and returns a response from the Elastic Email API on the response port, or an optional error info on the error port if one occurs. The plugin requires users to provide their Elastic Email Client Public Account ID, the email address of the new contact, and any additional fields they wish to map. The additional fields should use the field aliases from the Elastic Email API. The plugin also requires users to provide a JSON configuration, which includes the source ID and name of the Elastic Email resource, the email address of the new contact, and any additional mapping fields.
