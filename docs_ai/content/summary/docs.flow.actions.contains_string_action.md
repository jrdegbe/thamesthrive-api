This documentation is about the ContainsString Plugin, which is used to check if a data field contains a defined substring. The plugin is configured using a JSON configuration, which is provided as an example in the documentation. The configuration includes two fields: "field" and "substring". The "field" field is used to specify the data field that should be checked for the substring, while the "substring" field is used to specify the substring that should be searched for in the data field. The plugin outputs the payload on ports TRUE if the field contains the substring, or FALSE if otherwise. 

This plugin is useful for checking if a data field contains a specific substring, which can be used for various purposes such as filtering data or validating data. It is also useful for quickly checking if a data field contains a specific substring without having to manually search through the data field.
