This documentation describes the event "Order Completed" which should be used when a customer completes an order. It outlines the expected properties of the event, which are all optional, and provides an example of the JSON format. It also explains the auto indexing process, which helps to organize unstructured data, and which event properties will be copied to event traits. Finally, it states that no data will be copied to the profile.
