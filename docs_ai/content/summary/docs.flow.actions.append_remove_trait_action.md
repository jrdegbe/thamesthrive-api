This plugin allows users to append or remove values from arrays. The configuration for this plugin is written in JSON format and includes two objects, "append" and "remove". The "append" object contains two key-value pairs, with the key being the array to append to and the value being the array to append from. The "remove" object contains one key-value pair, with the key being the array to remove from and the value being the array to remove. This plugin will append the value from the specified array to the specified array, or remove the value from the specified array. This plugin is useful for adding or removing values from arrays in order to keep data up to date.
