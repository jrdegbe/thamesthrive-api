This documentation text provides information about a ValidationError that can occur when calling a webhook. The error 
message states that the value sent in the post payload is not a valid dict. This means that the post payload was not 
sent as a dict, which is an object in JavaScript. To resolve this issue, the user should send an empty object in the 
post body/payload, such as {} or an object with data, such as {“key”:”value”}. This should resolve the ValidationError 
and allow the webhook to be called successfully. 

In addition to the information about the ValidationError, this documentation text also provides instructions on how to 
resolve the issue. It explains that the user should send an empty object or an object with data in the post body/payload 
in order to successfully call the webhook. This should resolve the ValidationError and allow the webhook to be called 
without any further issues.
