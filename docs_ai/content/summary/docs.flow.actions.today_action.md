This documentation is for a plugin that reads a time in a given time zone. The configuration for the plugin is a JSON object that contains a "timezone" key with a value that is either a path to timezone data or a plain text. The time zone must be in the format of "country/city" and a detailed list of timezones can be found at the provided link. The output of the plugin is also a JSON object that contains the UTC time, a timestamp, and two objects for the server and local time. The server time object contains the day of the week, day, month, year, week, hour, minute, second, millisecond, time, fold, and ISO. The local time object contains the same information as the server time object.
