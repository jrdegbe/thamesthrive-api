This plugin is designed to take a string as an input and replace any fragments that match a given regex. The plugin takes any payload as an input and returns the regex after operations on the port 'replaced' if matches were found, or the given string on the port 'not_found' if the given value was not containing any fragment matching the given regex. The plugin is configured using a JSON configuration which requires three parameters: a string, a regex that will match fragments to replace, and a string to replace with. The string parameter is the path to the string that you want to operate on, the find_regex parameter is the regex that will match fragments to replace, and the replace_with parameter is the path to the string that you want to replace with. This plugin is a useful tool for quickly replacing strings that match a given regex.
