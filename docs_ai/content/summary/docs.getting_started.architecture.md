ThamesThrive is a distributed system that is designed to track and analyze customer data. It consists of several components that work together to provide a comprehensive solution. The core components of ThamesThrive include a database for storing events, a data processing library, a RESTful API and GraphQL API for interacting with the system, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for end users. Additionally, ThamesThrive includes background workers that perform background processes such as importing and segmentation. 

The data processing library is a key component of ThamesThrive API that handles the workflow for selected events and transfers them to external systems. Programmers can use this library to develop ThamesThrive plugins. The GUI is a graphical interface that runs in the user's browser and allows end users to interact with the system. The background workers perform background processes such as merging and segmentation. 

For the system to work fully, at least four elements must be activated: the database, the API, the GUI, and the background import worker. The GUI connects to the API, which in turn connects to the database. In addition to the core components of ThamesThrive, the system may also include additional elements such as background processes for profile merging and segmentation, data bridges for connecting to external systems, microservices, and more.
