This documentation provides instructions on how to set up a Chatwoot inbox. The first step is to log-in to the chatwoot.com website. Once logged in, the user should select the Chatwoot icon and click the new inbox option in the left menu. The user should then select the website they wish to set up the inbox for and fill out the form. The user should then select an agent and they will be presented with a javascript snippet. The user should not copy and paste the entire snippet, but instead copy only the website token which is marked <TOKEN-IS-HERE> in the example script. Once the token is copied, the user can paste it into the appropriate place on their website.
