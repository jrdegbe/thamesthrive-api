This documentation provides information about the event "Search" and the expected properties associated with it. The properties are optional and if any property is missing, it will not be processed and no error will be reported. The event properties will be auto indexed to create a structure that organizes the data. This structure is made by copying information from the different parts of the data and putting it into a specific format that can be used to analyze and group the data. The table provided in the documentation outlines which event property will be copied to event traits. The data will not be copied to profile. Lastly, the documentation provides a JSON example of the event.
