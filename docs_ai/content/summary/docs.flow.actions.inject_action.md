The Inject node is a useful tool for debugging workflows by allowing users to inject data into the internal state of the workflow. This node can be used to simulate specific conditions or scenarios that can be used for testing purposes or for troubleshooting issues that may occur during the workflow execution. To use the Inject node, users will need to define the payload that they want to inject by configuring the node properties to specify the payload data. Once the payload is defined, users can click the "debug" button to execute the workflow with the injected data. 

The data that is injected can be of various types, including strings, integers, or objects. The Inject node will trigger the workflow when the "debug" button is clicked, and the injected data will be available for subsequent nodes in the workflow to process. Additionally, users can select where the data should be injected, with options including "Event Properties", "Payload", "Profile PII", "Profile Traits", "Profile Interests", "Profile Counters", "Profile Consents", and "Session Context". However, it is important to note that this action will not run in deployed workflows, as it is a debug node.
