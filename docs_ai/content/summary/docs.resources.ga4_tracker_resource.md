Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic, currently as a
platform inside the Google Marketing Platform brand. To find your Google Analytics 4 Measurement ID, users must open
Google Analytics, click the ‘Admin’ tab, left-hand side menu, at the bottom. In the left-hand column, click Data Streams
and select a data stream from the list. The code will appear in the top right-hand corner of the page and start with
“G.” This code should be copied and pasted into the ThamesThrive Resource Form into the measurement_id field. To find the
API Key, users must find the Secret API Keys in the Events section and click on it. If the key is not visible, users
should click create in the upper right corner, give the key a name, and save it. The API Key should then be copied into
the API Key (api_key) field in the ThamesThrive Resource Form.
