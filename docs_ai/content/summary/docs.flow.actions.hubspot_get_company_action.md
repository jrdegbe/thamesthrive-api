This plugin allows users to get a company from HubSpot, based on a provided company ID. The plugin takes any payload as input and returns a response from the HubSpot API on the response port, or optional error info on the error port if one occurs. 

In order to use the plugin, users must first create an app in their HubSpot developer account. This plugin uses OAuth 2.0, so users must initiate an OAuth connection between their app and HubSpot. To do this, users must go to the app auth page on the HubSpot website and fill out the client ID and client secret fields, as well as define a redirect URL and scopes. The redirect URL must use https in production, and http can be used when testing using localhost. Additionally, users must choose the crm.objects.companies.read scope in order to use this plugin. After filling out the fields, users must copy the link and open it. They will then be asked to grant access to their app, and will be redirected to a site with a code that can be used later. 

The plugin can be configured either with a form or with a JSON configuration. With the form, users must provide their client ID and client secret, as well as their refresh token if they have one. They must also provide the company ID of the company they want to get. With the JSON configuration, users must provide their access token (optionally) and their company ID.
