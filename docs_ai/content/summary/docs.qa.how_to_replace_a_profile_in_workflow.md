This documentation provides a step-by-step guide on how to replace a profile in a workflow. It explains how to create a workflow with a start and end node, and then add a "Load Profile by" node and connect it to the start node. The user is then instructed to select the field (e.g., email) that they would like to use to identify the profile, and send the email in the event properties. An "Event Properties" node is then added and connected to the "Load Profile by" node for debugging purposes. The workflow is then run and the state of the profile is checked to ensure it was successfully loaded. If the email is misspelled, an error will be thrown indicating that no record was found. Finally, the user is advised to consider what to do with events that do not have a profile (e.g., discard the event or keep it for further analysis).
