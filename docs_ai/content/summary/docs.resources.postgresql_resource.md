This documentation provides instructions on how to configure and set up a PostgreSQL database. It outlines the steps necessary to connect to a PostgreSQL server, including the host address, port, username, and password. The host address is the address where the server was installed, and the port is usually set to the default of 5432. The username and password are set during the installation of the PostgreSQL server. Once these steps are completed, the user should be able to connect to the PostgreSQL server.
