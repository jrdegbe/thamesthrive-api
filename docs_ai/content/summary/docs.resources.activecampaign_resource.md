ActiveCampaign is a Customer Experience Automation Platform that allows users to send email campaigns, automate features, and manage contacts. To enable an integration between ActiveCampaign and ThamesThrive, users need to obtain an API key. This can be done by logging into ActiveCampaign, clicking the "Settings" (gear icon) on the left menu, selecting the "Developer" option, and copying the API URL and Key into the ThamesThrive resource form. For more help with getting the API key, users can visit the ActiveCampaign help page at https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/207317590-Getting-started-with-the-API#getting-started-with-the-api-0-0. With the API key, users can sync contact information, view contact information, add contacts to automations, create and send campaigns, and much more.
