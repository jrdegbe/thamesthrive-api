This documentation provides instructions on how to quickly copy the configuration of an existing node to a new node. The
process involves identifying the node to be copied, accessing the advanced configuration options for the new node,
copying the JSON code of the existing node, creating a new node of the same type, pasting the JSON code into the new
node's advanced configuration options, and reviewing the configuration of the new node to ensure that everything has
been copied correctly. This process is a quick and easy way to replicate the configuration of an existing node to a new
node.
