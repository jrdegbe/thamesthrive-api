This plugin reads how many events of a defined type were triggered within a defined time. The configuration for the plugin requires two values, the event_type and the time_span. The event_type should be a string containing the type of event that the user wants to count. The time_span should be a string containing the time span which the user wants to search in. For example, using "-1h30min" as the time_span on March 1st, 2022 at 1:00 a.m. would result in searching through all events that happened between February 28th, 2022 at 11:30 p.m. and March 1st, 2022 at 1:00 a.m. The presence of the "-" sign in the time_span does not matter, since it is stripped anyway. For more details, the user can visit the pytimeparse library documentation.

The plugin outputs the number of found events. An example output would be {"events" : 39}. This plugin is useful for users who want to count the number of events of a certain type that have occurred within a certain time span.
