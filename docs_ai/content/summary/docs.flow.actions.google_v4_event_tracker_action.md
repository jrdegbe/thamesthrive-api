This plugin allows users to send events to Google Analytics 4. It requires two parameters to be specified in the JSON configuration: the name of the event and the parameters associated with the event. The name of the event should describe the action taken on the website, such as "Refund". The parameters should include all the details associated with the event, such as "Currency-USD". The plugin will return a result on the output port in the form of a JSON schema, which includes a status code and a response content. This plugin is useful for tracking user activity on a website and providing detailed analytics.
