This plugin is designed to connect to a weather server and retrieve weather information. It requires configuration to be set up, which includes the type of temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit) and the city. The city can be a path to data or a plain text. The input payload is not processed by this plugin. The output of the plugin is a JSON object containing the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and description of the weather. An example of the output is provided in the documentation.
