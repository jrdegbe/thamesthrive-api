This documentation provides information about the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, an OASIS standard messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT). It is designed to be an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport that is ideal for connecting remote devices with a small code footprint and minimal network bandwidth. 

In order to connect to MQTT, the user needs to have the following information: the URL of the MQTT server, the port of the MQTT server, the username, and the password. All of these pieces of information are required and none can be left empty.
