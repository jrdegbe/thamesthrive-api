All of these properties are optional and will not cause errors if they are not included. Additionally, auto indexing is used to make data easy to find by creating a structure that organizes the data. This structure is made by copying information from the different parts of the data and putting it into a specific format that can be used to analyze and group the data. The table provided in the documentation outlines which event property will be copied to event traits. Lastly, the documentation provides a JSON example and a tracker example of how to track the 'Product Clicked' event.
