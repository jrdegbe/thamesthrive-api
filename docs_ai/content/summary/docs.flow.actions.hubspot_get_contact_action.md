This plugin allows users to get a contact from HubSpot, based on provided data. It takes any payload as input and returns response from HubSpot API on port **response**, or optional error info on port **error** if one occurs. In order to use this plugin, users need to create an app in their HubSpot account. This can be done by going to hubspot.com -> login -> choose your account -> settings -> account setup -> integrations -> private app. When creating the app, users need to choose the crm.schemas.contacts.read scope, as well as the crm.objects.companies.write, crm.objects.companies.read, crm.objects.contacts.write, and content scopes. Once the app is created, users can access the access token for the app. 

The plugin can be configured either with a form or with a JSON configuration. With the form, users need to provide their HubSpot resource, which should contain their access token, as well as the contact id of the contact they want to get. With the JSON configuration, users need to provide their access token and contact id in the JSON format.
