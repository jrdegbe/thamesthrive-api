Mixpanel is a business analytics service company that provides tools for tracking user interactions with web and mobile applications and targeted communication with them. It collects data to build custom reports and measure user engagement and retention. To enable an integration between Mixpanel and ThamesThrive, an API is needed. Mixpanel has developed a number of APIs for clients to use that provide a substantial amount of added functionality and give clients the means to customize data analysis. 

Project tokens are used for API authentication and are sent along with each piece of data sent to the project. To view the Project token, the user must first click the icon with their initials in the Mixpanel header bar. Under "PERSONAL SETTINGS", they must click Profile & Preferences. Then, they must click Project in the left navigation bar and in "Projects" they will see each project in the organization. Each project contains values for its token, API key, and API secret. If more help is needed with getting the Project Token, the user can visit the provided link.
