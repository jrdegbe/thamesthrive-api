This documentation provides information on how to adjust the maximum number of connections to an Elastic node. It states that by default, there are up to 10 connections open to each node. If more connections are needed, the ELASTIC_MAX_CONN parameter can be used to raise the limit. To do this, the user must add the following line of code to their ThamesThrive configuration: ```yaml ELASTIC_MAX_CONN: 10```. This code will allow the user to increase the number of connections to an Elastic node, allowing for more efficient communication between the node and the user.
