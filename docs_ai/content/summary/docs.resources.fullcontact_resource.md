This documentation provides instructions on how to set up and configure Full Contact, a cloud-based contact identity
resolution platform. Full Contact provides data intelligence to accurately identify people and optimize experiences
while prioritizing privacy and security. To get started, users must first create an account at the Full Contact website.
Once logged in, users should select the API Keys option from the left menu. Then, they should click Generate New Key and
copy the token to the ThamesThrive form. It is important to note that the token is only shown once, so users should save the
ThamesThrive form once they have copied the token. Following these steps will ensure that users are able to properly
configure and set up Full Contact.
