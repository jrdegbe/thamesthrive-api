This documentation describes a plugin that will return a payload on the TRUE port if the event indicates that this is a new visit. The plugin will trigger only on the first page view of the visit when a new session is created, and will not trigger on subsequent clicks within the same visit. The visit is considered finished when the user leaves the page and closes the browser. The output of the plugin is a payload on either the TRUE or FALSE port, depending on whether or not this is a new visit. 

This plugin can be used to track the number of visits to a website, as well as to track the activity of individual users. It can also be used to determine when a user has left the website, and to provide a more accurate picture of user engagement. Additionally, this plugin can be used to provide insights into user behavior, such as how often they visit the website, how long they stay on the website, and what pages they visit.
