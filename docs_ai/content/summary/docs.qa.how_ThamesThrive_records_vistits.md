ThamesThrive uses the concept of a session to calculate visits. A session is identified by a session ID, which is typically a randomly generated number such as a UUID4. The session ID is used to track a user's activity and determine the duration of their visit. ThamesThrive considers a continuous stream of events with the same session ID as a single visit.

For web data collection, ThamesThrive relies on the session ID stored in a cookie. When a user opens a web page, ThamesThrive's JavaScript code creates a session and saves the session ID in a cookie. As long as the user continues browsing the website without closing their browser, the same session ID is used and associated with each event generated by the user's actions. If the user closes their browser, the cookie is deleted, indicating the end of the session. When the user visits the website again, a new session ID is generated, and a new visit begins.

For data collected from other sources, such as mobile apps, the definition of a visit may vary. In the mobile app context, a visit can start when the user opens the app and ends when the user closes it. To track visits in this scenario, the mobile app needs to generate a session ID when the app starts and include the same session ID in every event sent to ThamesThrive. ThamesThrive monitors session changes and increments the visit counter accordingly.

In cases where data is collected from an external system or data source where it is not clear when a session starts or ends, developers can define a session based on the data that exists in the external system. For example, they can use a visit ID or device ID as a session identifier. If no specific identifier is available, developers can define a session as a fixed time period, such as 15 minutes, 10 events, etc. or choose to include all events in one session. Then generate one UUID4 session ID and keep it the same for all events.
