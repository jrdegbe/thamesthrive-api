This documentation describes the StartsWith Plugin, which is used to check if a data field starts with a defined prefix. The plugin is configured using a JSON configuration, which is provided as an example in the documentation. The example input includes two fields, "field" and "prefix", which are used to define the data field and the prefix to be checked. The plugin will output the payload on the TRUE port if the field contains the prefix, or on the FALSE port if it does not. This plugin can be used to quickly check if a data field starts with a specific prefix, and can be used to filter out data that does not meet the criteria.
