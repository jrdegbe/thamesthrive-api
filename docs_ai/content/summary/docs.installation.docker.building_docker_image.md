The documentation provides instructions on how to build a ThamesThrive docker image from source. It explains that the user should clone the ThamesThrive repository from Github, go to the ThamesThrive folder, and run the docker build command. After the docker is built, the user can run it with the command provided. The documentation also provides a note that the user should replace <your-laptop-ip> with their laptop IP, and a tip that on Windows the user can use the ipconfig command to find out their laptop IP.
