This plugin calculates the time difference between two dates. It takes two dates as input, either as a reference date or a path to a date, and the second date can be either the time of workflow execution or a specific date. The plugin returns the time difference information on port ```time_difference``` in the form of an object with the following information: seconds, minutes, hours, days, and weeks. The values can be floats. For more information about the correct formats for the dates, users can check the link provided in the documentation.
