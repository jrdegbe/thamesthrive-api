This plugin is designed to check if the local time is within a defined time span. It takes into account the time zone of the event, which must be provided in the configuration. The configuration also requires the start and end of the time span to be set. An example of the configuration is provided in the documentation. This node does not process input payload, and returns the input payload on either the IN port or OUT port, depending on whether the local time is within the defined time span.
