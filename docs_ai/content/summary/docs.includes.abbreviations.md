This documentation provides an overview of four key terms related to web development: HTML, W3C, API, and GUI. HTML, or Hyper Text Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It is used to structure and present content on the web, and is the foundation of most websites. W3C, or World Wide Web Consortium, is an international organization that sets standards for web development. It is responsible for the development of HTML and other web technologies. 

API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of protocols and tools used to build software applications. It is used to allow different applications to communicate with each other, and is an important part of web development. Finally, GUI, or Graphical User Interface, is a type of user interface that allows users to interact with a computer system through graphical elements such as icons, menus, and buttons. It is used to make web applications easier to use and more visually appealing.
