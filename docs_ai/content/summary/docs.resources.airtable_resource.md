Airtable is a cloud collaboration service that combines the features of a database and a spreadsheet. It allows users to create, fetch, update, and delete records in the bases they have access to. To connect Airtable to ThamesThrive, users need an API key. This key can be found in the user's Airtable account page in the "API section". If the user already has an API key defined, they can click in the purple text box and the API key will appear. If the user does not have an account or needs more help with getting their API key, they can visit the Airtable support page for more information.
