This plugin allows users to fetch funnel created in MixPanel, for current profile. It requires MixPanel account with created project, and a service account created for this project. Credentials for the service account must be included in resource, as well as server prefix (either EU or US). The plugin takes any payload as input and outputs fetched funnel on port **success**, or an error message (if it's known one) on port **error** if one occurs.

The configuration for this plugin includes form fields such as MixPanel resource, Project ID, Funnel ID, Lower time bound and Upper time bound. The MixPanel resource should contain service account username, password and server prefix. The Project ID can be found under Settings > Project settings > <your-project-name>. The Funnel ID can be found in URL when inspecting your funnel (**...app/funnels#view/<funnel-id>/...**). The Lower time bound and Upper time bound can be a timestamp, a datetime, or a string in form of **YYYY-MM-DD**. Other formats are not supported. The JSON configuration for this plugin includes source, project_id, funnel_id, from_date and to_date.
