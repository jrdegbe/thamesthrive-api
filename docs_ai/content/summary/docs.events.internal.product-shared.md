This documentation provides information about the "Product Shared" event, which should be used when a customer shares a product with others, such as by sending a link to the product page via email or social media. This event can provide valuable insights into how customers are engaging with your products and can help you identify which products are being shared the most. An example of when this event would be triggered is when a customer is browsing your website and finds a product they like, clicks on the "Share" button, and chooses to send a link to the product page to a friend via email. 

The documentation also provides information about the expected properties of the event, which are all optional. If any property is missing, it will not be processed and no error will be reported. The expected properties are "media" (string) and "id" (string). Additionally, the documentation provides information about auto indexing, which helps to make data easy to find by creating a structure that organizes the data. This structure is made by copying information from the different parts of the data and putting it into a specific format that can be used to analyze and group the data. The table provided in the documentation describes which event property will be copied to event traits. Finally, the documentation states that data will not be copied to profile and provides a JSON example of the event.
