This plugin allows users to remove contacts from their MailChimp audience based on provided data. Before using this plugin, users need to create a MailChimp account, generate a marketing API key, and add MailChimp to their resources. The plugin takes a payload - any JSON-like object - as input. The output of the plugin is the MailChimp API response on the response port if the action was successful, or an error from the MailChimp API on the error port if one occurs. 

The plugin can be configured with either a form or a JSON. When configuring with a form, users need to select their MailChimp resource, enter the ID of their list (audience), provide the contact's email address, and determine whether the contact should be archived or permanently deleted. When configuring with JSON, users need to provide the ID and name of their MailChimp source, the ID of their audience, the path to the field containing emails, and a boolean value for the delete option. 

Users can find their audience ID by clicking Audience, All contacts, selecting their current audience from the drop-down menu, clicking the Settings drop-down, choosing Audience name and defaults, and finding the Audience ID section. It is important to note that when using the delete option, there is a risk of losing data as an email cannot be added without the consent of its owner again.
