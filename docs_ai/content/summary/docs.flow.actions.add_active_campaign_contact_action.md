This plugin allows users to add a contact to their ActiveCampaign account. It takes any payload as input and returns the created contact's info on the success port if the action was successful, or some error info on the error port if there was an error. The plugin requires configuration in the form of a JSON object, which includes the source (the ID and name of the ActiveCampaign resource) and the fields (the path to the email, last name, etc.). This plugin is useful for users who want to add contacts to their ActiveCampaign account quickly and easily.
