This documentation provides information about the Update Event Action node. This node is used when new information needs to be appended to an event and saved. It is connected in the flow and marks the event to be updated just after the flow ends. No configuration is required for this node and it does not require any input data. It is important to note that the update will not be triggered in debug mode.
