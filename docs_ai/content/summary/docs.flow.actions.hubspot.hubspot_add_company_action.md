This plugin documentation provides information about a plugin that adds a new company to HubSpot, based on provided data. The plugin takes any payload as input and returns a response from the HubSpot API on port response, or error info on port error if one occurs. To connect ThamesThrive with HubSpot, a HubSpot resource must be created. The resource must have the following rights: crm.objects.companies.write and crm.objects.companies.read. The plugin can be configured either with a form or with a JSON configuration. The form requires the HubSpot resource to be selected and properties to be added for the contact, using field aliases from HubSpot. The JSON configuration requires a source with an ID and name, as well as properties with a name and description.
