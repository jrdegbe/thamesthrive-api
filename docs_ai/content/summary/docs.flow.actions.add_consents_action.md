This plugin allows users to grant consents by filling out a form. The data is sent to ThamesThrive as an event with properties set to the granted consents. The consents payload should be in the form of a JSON object with the consent IDs as keys and boolean values indicating whether the consent was granted or not. The plugin reads the data referenced in the configuration and adds it to the profile if it is valid. If there is no error, the plugin returns the input payload (unchanged) on the port 'payload'. This plugin is useful for ensuring that customers are able to grant consents in a secure and efficient manner.
