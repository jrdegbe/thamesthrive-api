This documentation explains how to use the Template Plugin. The plugin requires a template that contains placeholders
with referenced data. Placeholders start with {{ and end with }}. The placeholders are replaced by the referenced data,
which is explained in the link to the dot notation documentation. An example of the template is provided, which shows
how to reference data from the payload. The plugin returns a string with the placeholder replaced by values from the
referenced data. The workflow internal state documentation provides more information on the data saved inside the
workflow.
