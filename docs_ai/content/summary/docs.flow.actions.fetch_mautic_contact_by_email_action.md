This plugin provides a way to fetch a contact from Mautic, based on a provided contact email address. It takes any payload as input and returns a response from the Mautic API on the port **response**, or an optional error info on the port **error** if one occurs. The plugin configuration requires two form fields: Mautic resource and Contact email address. The Mautic resource should contain the Mautic API URL, Mautic Client private key, and Mautic Client public key. The Contact email address should be the path to the email address of the contact that you want to fetch. Additionally, the plugin provides an advanced configuration option in the form of a JSON object. This object should contain the source ID and name of the Mautic resource, as well as the path to the contact email address.
