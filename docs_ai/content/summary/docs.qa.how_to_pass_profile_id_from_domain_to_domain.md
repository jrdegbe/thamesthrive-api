This feature is beneficial if you want to ensure that the same profile ID is created within owned domains. It allows you to rewrite links on the page to contain the current profile and pass it to destination domain. To activate this feature, add `trackExternalLinks` to `settings` in the JavaScript code. This will automatically update all `A.href` links on the page with the `__tr_pid`, `__tr_src` parameter, which will contain the current profile ID, source ID respectively. 

ThamesThrive checks if there is referer data containing a profile ID and source ID. If it exists and is valid, it merges the referred profile with the existing profile in the local storage on the visited page (domain). If there is no existing profile on visited page, it replaces current generated profile ID with the referred one. It also invalidates the session if it has the wrong profile ID and creates a new session if none exists. If the referred profile ID is invalid, it logs a warning. Similarly, if the referred source ID is invalid, it logs a warning and shows the error message.
