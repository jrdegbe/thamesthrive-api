This plugin fetches data from an InfluxDB resource. It takes any payload as input and returns fetched records on the success port, or an object with an error message on the error port if one occurs. The plugin requires configuration in the form of form fields and JSON configuration. 

The form fields include the InfluxDB resource, organization, bucket, filters, lower time bound, and upper time bound. The InfluxDB resource requires an ID and name, the organization requires a name, the bucket requires a name, the filters require key-value pairs, and the lower and upper time bounds require either relative or fixed values. 

The JSON configuration requires a source, organization, bucket, filters, start, and stop. The source requires an ID and name, the organization requires a name, the bucket requires a name, the filters require key-value pairs, and the start and stop require either relative or fixed values. 

This plugin is useful for retrieving data from an InfluxDB resource and can be configured to filter the data based on the form fields and JSON configuration.
