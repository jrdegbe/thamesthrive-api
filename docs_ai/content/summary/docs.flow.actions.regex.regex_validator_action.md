This plugin is used to validate data with regex pattern. It requires configuration, which includes the regex pattern and the data to be validated. The data can either be a path to data in the profile, session, or event, or a plain string. Depending on the validation result, the appropriate port will be launched with the payload copied as data. This node does not process input payload.
