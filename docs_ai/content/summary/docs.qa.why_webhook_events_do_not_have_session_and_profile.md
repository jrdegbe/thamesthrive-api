The documentation explains why webhook events do not have session and profile information by default. This is because most external systems are not aware of the Tracaardi Profile ID and session ID, and it is difficult to pass session information through a URL in external systems. To address this limitation, the documentation provides an option to replace or set the profile ID or session ID of the event collected by the webhook URL using the payload data. This allows users to customize and manage the session and profile information associated with webhook events effectively. 

When configuring webhook integrations, it is important to keep in mind that the default behavior does not include session and profile information. However, by extracting and manipulating the relevant data from the payload, users can integrate their desired session and profile details into webhook events seamlessly. This ensures that the webhook events are properly configured and that the session and profile information is accurately captured.
