Responses typically include the profile ID and may also contain additional data if\nconfigured.\n\nResponses can be considered as the output of workflows, which are executed based on the configurations and logic defined\nwithin them. These responses are consolidated into a single response, which can then be further processed, analyzed, or\nused to trigger subsequent actions.\n\nResponses may also contain additional information, such as the response key, which is a defined field that includes the\ndata returned by a specific workflow. The response key helps organize and structure the data collected from different\nworkflows, making it easier to access and utilize in downstream processes.\n"}
