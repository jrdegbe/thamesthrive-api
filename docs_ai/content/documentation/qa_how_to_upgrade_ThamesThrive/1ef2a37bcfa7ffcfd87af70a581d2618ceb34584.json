Follow the instructions provided in the script to complete the data migration. This feature is only available\nin ThamesThrive version 0.7.2 and higher. If you are using an older version, you will need to upgrade to at least 0.7.2 in\norder to access this functionality.\n\nWhen performing multiple upgrades of ThamesThrive, the system will create a large number of new indices, which may cause you\nto reach the Elasticsearch limit of 1000 indices. To resolve this issue, you can either increase the limit in the\nElasticsearch configuration or delete the indices used by old ThamesThrive versions. ThamesThrive version 0.8.0 includes a\nfeature in the GUI to delete old indices. If you are using an older version, you can use the API to delete old indices,\nsuch as issuing a HTTP DELETE call to /indices/version/0.7.2 to delete the 0.7.2 version indices. However, be cautious\nwhen deleting old data, as there is no way to revert the system to a previous version.", "hash": "1ef2a37bcfa7ffcfd87af70a581d2618ceb34584"}
