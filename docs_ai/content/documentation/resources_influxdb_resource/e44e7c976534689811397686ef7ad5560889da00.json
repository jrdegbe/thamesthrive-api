  "answer": "# Resource configuration and set-up\nIn order to enable an integration between __InfluxDB__ and ThamesThrive you need an API. The __InfluxDB__ API provides a programmatic \ninterface for all interactions with __InfluxDB__, it uses API tokens to authorize API requests. API tokens ensure secure \ninteraction between __InfluxDB__ and ThamesThrive. An API token belongs to a specific user and identifies InfluxDB permissions \nwithin the user\u2019s organization.\n\nTo manage InfluxDB API Tokens in the __InfluxDB UI__:\n\n1. Navigate to the API Tokens management page.\n2. In the navigation menu on the left, select Data (Load Data) > Tokens.\n3. Click a token name in the list to view the token and a summary of access permissions.\n\nFor Creating a token in the __InfluxDB UI__:\n\n1.
