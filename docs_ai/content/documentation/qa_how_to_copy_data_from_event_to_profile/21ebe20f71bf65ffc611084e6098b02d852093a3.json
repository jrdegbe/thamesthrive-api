How do pre-built event types simplify the data collection process?"], "answer": "# How can you copy data from events to profiles?\nTo copy data from events to profiles, you will need to create a workflow with a start node and a node called \"\ncopy data\". In the \"copy data\" node, you can select the destination and set it to the event property e.g. \"phone\", \"\nemail\", etc. Another way to copy data is to use the \"Auto group merge event properties\" node, which will automatically\nmerge all event properties to the profile traits.\n\n## Auto coping\n\nThamesThrive offers an easy way to copy data from events to profiles with its auto-coping feature, available in the\ncommercial version. Users can define an event type and specify which properties to copy, and the system will handle the\ncopying automatically.\n\n## Pre-build event types\n\nStarting from version 0.8.1, ThamesThrive includes build-in event types that can be used for auto-coping. These internal\nevent types are designed to track the customer journey on websites or applications, and they come with default\nproperties that eliminate the need for manual copying.\n\nUsing these internal event types streamlines the use of ThamesThrive and simplifies the process of data collection and\nanalysis. When an internal event type is utilized, the system automatically detects it and populates the profile and\nsession with relevant data. To learn more about the available default event types, [please refer to the provided list](../events/internal/index.md).\n", "hash": "21ebe20f71bf65ffc611084e6098b02d852093a3"}
