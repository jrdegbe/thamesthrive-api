Moreover, you also need to set beacon to True. A beacon is an event that\nis sent even if the customer leaves the page. It allows you to track user interactions that may occur after a user has\nnavigated away from a page, providing valuable insights into user behavior.\n\n```javascript title=\"Example\" linenums=\"1\"\nwindow.tracker.track(\"page-view\", {}, {\"fire\": true, asBeacon: true});\n```\n"}
