To perform segmentation, you need a profile,\nwhich is identified by a unique profile ID in ThamesThrive. There are different ways to do segmentation.\n\n1. Real-time Segmentation: This method involves categorizing customers in real time based on specific events or actions\n   they take. For example, when a customer answers an email or visits a page a certain number of times, their profile is\n   automatically moved to a particular segment. ThamesThrive provides actions like \"add segment\" or \"delete segment\" in\n   workflows to perform real-time segmentation based on defined conditions real-time when the data changes.\n\n2. Time-triggered Segmentation: This method starts the segmentation process based on the absence of certain events or\n   actions. For instance, if a customer hasn't made a purchase or visited your page for a specified period, a\n   time-triggered segmentation process is initiated. ThamesThrive runs this process periodically, such as every hour, to\n   check if the defined condition is met.\n\n3. Ad hoc Segmentation: This method involves segmenting customers based on existing data. It includes selecting profiles\n   using available data, such as demographic information (age, shoe size, location), to create segments. While this\n   method is less sophisticated compared to the others, it can still be useful for filtering based on aggregated values\n   like the number of specific events or the most recent event type. However, adhoc segmentation is limited when it\n   comes to segmenting based on event sequences or external data.\n\nAt present, ThamesThrive exclusively provides first two segmentation methods. However, numerous scenarios that involve the\nthird method can be accomplished by employing the first two methods or post event segmentation. For instance, when\nsegmenting based on existing data such as gender, one can identify the event responsible for altering the gender and\nsegment the profile in real-time as the data changes. This can be achieved by using post event segmentation or executing\nan if statement and utilizing the \"add segment\" action to assign the relevant segment to the profile in the workflow.\n", "hash": "a94c50c7b231466988f7135ec6be6aeb2290f076"}
