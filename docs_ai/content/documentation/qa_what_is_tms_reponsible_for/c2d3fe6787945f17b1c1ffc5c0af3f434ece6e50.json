It is a separate microservice. Its responsibilities include:\n\n1. `Creating tenants`: The TMS handles the creation of new tenant accounts within the system, setting up the necessary\n   infrastructure and resources for them to operate.\n\n2. `Returning tenants`: The service allows for retrieving information about existing tenants, providing functionality to\n   query and access tenant-specific data, settings, and attributes.\n\n3. `Validating tenants`: The TMS ensures the validity of tenants, particularly within ThamesThrive. It checks if a tenant is\n   registered and authorized to access the system.\n\n4. `Storing tenant-specific data`: The TMS manages the storage of tenant-related data, such as installation tokens, tenant\n   email addresses, and additional attributes or mappings associated with each tenant. This data may include information\n   required for integration with partner systems.\n\n5. `ThamesThrive integration`: The TMS is used by ThamesThrive, a system operating in a multi-tenant environment where multiple\n   tenants log in. ThamesThrive relies on the TMS to validate tenant credentials and ensure they are registered. Other\n   operations like creating or deleting a tenant are also handled by the TMS.\n\nIn summary, a tenant management service is responsible for creating, returning, and validating tenants, storing\ntenant-specific data, and enabling the integration and management of tenants within platforms like ThamesThrive.\n", "hash": "c2d3fe6787945f17b1c1ffc5c0af3f434ece6e50"}
