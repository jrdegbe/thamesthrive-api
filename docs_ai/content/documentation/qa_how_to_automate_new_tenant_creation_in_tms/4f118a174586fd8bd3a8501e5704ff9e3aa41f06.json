This\n   call will create a new tenant and generate a corresponding URL for the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of ThamesThrive.\n\n2. **Provide the GUI URL to the partner**: If our partner wants their customer to directly access and install ThamesThrive,\n   then the partner can then share GUI URL with their customer, who can use it to access the GUI and perform the\n   installation process themselves. During installation, the customer will have the opportunity to set up the admin\n   account for ThamesThrive.\n\n3. **Alternative approach - Create the account via ThamesThrive API**: If the partner prefers not to have their customers\n   directly interact with ThamesThrive, they can use the ThamesThrive API instead. The partner can call the ThamesThrive API,\n   providing the installation token obtained from the TMS. This API call will create a new account specifically for that\n   tenant, ensuring the customer doesn't have to directly access ThamesThrive, but the account and corresponding instance is\n   created.\n\nIn summary, the automated installation process for a new tenant in ThamesThrive involves calling the TMS API to create the\ntenant and generate the GUI URL. Depending on the partner's preference, the customer can either install ThamesThrive\nthemselves using the GUI URL or have the partner create the account on their behalf using the ThamesThrive API.\n", "hash": "4f118a174586fd8bd3a8501e5704ff9e3aa41f06"}
