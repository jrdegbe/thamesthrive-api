If you do not have big traffic you\ncould run one cluster of APIs with 2 instances and install GUI on your local machine.\n\nQ: __Do ThamesThrive need any particular routing inside cluster?__ \nA: The internal routing from load balancer to ThamesThrive instances can be for example: round-robin. ThamesThrive do not \nrequire long-lasting sticky sessions.\n\nQ: __What load can take ThamesThrive?__\nA: We tested single instance of ThamesThrive with 25 workers connected to one instance of\nelasticsearch, and it was capable of responding to 600 requests per second.\n"}
