This structure is made by\ncopying information from the different parts of the data and putting it into a specific format that can be used to\nanalyze and group the data. This is particularly helpful when dealing with unstructured data that needs to be organized\nin order to be useful.\n\nThis table describes which event property will be copied to event traits.\n\n| Event trait      | Event properties   |\n|------------------|--------------------|\n| ec.product.id       | id                 |\n| ec.product.name     | name               |\n| ec.product.sku      | sku                |\n| ec.product.category | category           |\n| ec.product.brand    | brand              |\n| ec.product.variant  | variant            |\n| ec.product.price    | price              |\n| ec.product.quantity | quantity           | \n\n## Copy event data to profile\n\nData will not be copied to profile.\n\n## JSON example\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"product-removed-from-basket\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"price\": 19.99,\n    \"quantity\": 2,\n    \"sku\": \"TSB001\",\n    \"id\": \"12345\",\n    \"name\": \"Black T-Shirt\",\n    \"url\": {\n      \"page\": \"https://example.com/products/tsb001\"\n    },\n    \"brand\": \"Example Brand\",\n    \"variant\": {\n      \"color\": \"Black\",\n      \"size\": \"M\",\n      \"name\": \"Black T-Shirt - M\"\n    },\n    \"category\": \"Clothing\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n## Tracker example\n\n```javascript\nwindow.tracker.track(\"product-removed-from-basket\", {\n    \"price\": 19.99,\n    \"quantity\": 2,\n    \"sku\": \"TSB001\",\n    \"id\": \"12345\",\n    \"name\": \"Black T-Shirt\",\n    \"url\": {\n      \"page\": \"https://example.com/products/tsb001\"\n    },\n    \"brand\": \"Example Brand\",\n    \"variant\": {\n      \"color\": \"Black\",\n      \"size\": \"M\",\n      \"name\": \"Black T-Shirt - M\"\n    },\n    \"category\": \"Clothing\"\n  });\n```\n"}
