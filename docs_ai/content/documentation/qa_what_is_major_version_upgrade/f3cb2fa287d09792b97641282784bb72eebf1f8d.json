What indicates a major version upgrade in ThamesThrive?", "2. How does ThamesThrive handle data migration during major upgrades?", "3. What additional effort and planning may be required for major upgrades in ThamesThrive?"], "answer": "# What is major version upgrade?\nA major version upgrade refers to a significant update or release of a software system that introduces substantial\nchanges, including modifications to the underlying database structure.\n\nIn the context of ThamesThrive, a major version upgrade is indicated by a change in a number other than the last one in the\nversion. For example, upgrading from version 0.8.0 to version 0.8.1 would be considered a major upgrade.\n\nDuring a major version upgrade of ThamesThrive, there may be changes to the database schema or data structure. These changes\noften require data migration or data schema updates to ensure that the system functions properly with the new version.\nThamesThrive handles data migration during major upgrades using Elasticsearch's reindexing process.\n\nThe upgrade process typically involves running two copies of the system: one with the old version and one with the new\nversion. The migration process moves the data from the old version to the new version while ensuring data integrity and\nconsistency. Once the migration is complete, the Docker tag can be upgraded, and the system will automatically switch to\nthe new version.\n\nIt's important to note that major upgrades may require additional effort and planning compared to minor upgrades.\nThamesThrive provides migration scripts for all major versions, which help facilitate the upgrade process and ensure proper\ndata migration. However, skipping versions during major upgrades is not supported, and it's recommended to follow the\nupgrade path version by version for data integrity and system stability.\n", "hash": "f3cb2fa287d09792b97641282784bb72eebf1f8d"}
