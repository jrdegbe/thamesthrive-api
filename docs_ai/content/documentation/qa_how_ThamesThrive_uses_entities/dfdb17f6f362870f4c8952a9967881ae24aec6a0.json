In\nother words, entities offer a mechanism to store information that doesn't fit neatly into the event structure or you do\nnot want to keep this information in the event itself.\n\nFor example, let's consider a scenario where you want to track purchases made by users. Each purchase can be represented\nas an event, and the associated data, such as the item purchased, the price, and the transaction details, can be stored\nwithin the event itself.\n\nHowever, there might be additional information related to the purchase that doesn't fit well within the event structure.\nThis could include details like: if the confirmation email was sent by the workflow, or additional notes specific to\nthat purchase. Instead of trying to raise another event, you can utilize entities to store these supplementary details\nand retrieve them when needed.\n"}
