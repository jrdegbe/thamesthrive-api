What is the recommended way to structure the code for a plugin in ThamesThrive?"], "answer": "# Where should I place plugins in ThamesThrive code?\nIn ThamesThrive, you should place your plugins in the `ThamesThrive/process_engine/action/v1` folder. The recommended way to\nstructure the code for your plugin is to create a folder with the plugin name and place the `plugin.py` file inside it.\n\nHere's an example of how you can organize your plugin files:\n\n1. Create a folder with your plugin name. For example, `my_plugin`.\n\n2. Inside the `my_plugin` folder, place the `plugin.py` file. This file will contain the code for your plugin.\n\nThe file structure would look like this:\n\n```\nThamesThrive/\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 process_engine/\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 action/\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 v1/\n            \u2514\u2500\u2500 my_plugin/\n                \u2514\u2500\u2500 plugin.py\n```\n\nBy following this structure, you ensure that your plugin is placed in the appropriate directory within the ThamesThrive\ncodebase. This makes it easier to manage and maintain your plugins in a standardized manner.\n\n---\nThis document answers the questions:\n- How to write a custom plugin?", "hash": "d4d628cd94952ad02495074305aba90b8d7096c5"}
