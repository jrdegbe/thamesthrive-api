To resolve this issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the `setup_plugins.py` file in a text editor.\n2. Locate the section where other plugins are registered.\n3. Add the following code snippet to register your plugin:\n\n```python\n\"module-where-the-plugin-code-is-saved\": PluginMetadata(\n    test=PluginTest(\n        init={},  # Here, provide the initialization data for your plugin from the specification\n        resource={}  # Here, provide the resource initialization data if it exists\n    ),\n    plugin_registry=\"module-where-the-plugin-code-is-saved\"\n)\n```\n\n4. Replace `\"module-where-the-plugin-code-is-saved\"` with the actual module name or file path where your plugin code is\n   saved.\n5. Provide the necessary initialization data for your plugin in the `init` and `resource` fields.\n6. Save the `setup_plugins.py` file.\n7. Restart the ThamesThrive service for the changes to take effect.\n8. After restarting, your plugin should be visible on the plugin list in ThamesThrive.\n\nBy adding the plugin registration code to the `setup_plugins.py` file, you inform ThamesThrive about the existence of your\nplugin and make it accessible through the user interface.", "hash": "268693c95bbdd4bbd1dd168c2b2e1161448c2898"}
