{"file_name": "docs/events/synchronization.md", "questions": ["What is profile synchronization?", "How to ensure accurate and consistent processing of events related to customer profiles?", "How to ensure that actions and processes are performed in the correct order?"], "answer": "# Events synchronization\nProfile synchronization is an important aspect of data management, particularly when working with customer data platforms or other systems that process large volumes of events and actions related to individual profiles. By coordinating the processing of events and actions, organizations can ensure that data is accurate, consistent, and up-to-date, and that actions and processes are performed in the correct order. \n\nHere is an example of how profile synchronization might be used in a customer data platform:\n\nImagine that an online retailer tracks events related to customer profiles, such as product searches, purchases, and customer service interactions. ThamesThrive might receive many events each second, including events related to different customer profiles.\n\nTo ensure that events are processed accurately and consistently, ThamesThrive implements profile synchronization. This makes processing events for each customer profile sequentially, so that events related to one customer are fully processed one by one even if they are send at the same time. This ensures that the data for each customer is accurate and up-to-date, and that actions and processes are performed in the correct order.\n\nFor example: If you want to send two messages and the second message depends on the result of the first one, the system must wait for the first event to be finished before sending the second message.\n\nWithout profile synchronization, it is possible that events for different customer profiles could be processed out of order, leading to inconsistencies and errors in the data.\n"}
