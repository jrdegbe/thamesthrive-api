Look for the JSON icon, typically located in the toolbar.\n* Click on the JSON icon to open the advanced configuration panel. This panel allows you to view and edit the JSON\n  representation of the node's configuration.\n* This JSON contains all the necessary information to recreate the node.\n* Select the entire JSON code and copy it to the clipboard. You can usually do this by right-clicking and choosing the \"\n  Copy\" option, or by using the keyboard shortcut (e.g., Ctrl+C or Command+C).\n* Create a new node in your desired location. Ensure that the new node you create is the same type as this existing\n  node.\n* Once the new node is created, access its advanced configuration options as before and open the JSON panel.\n* In the JSON panel, paste the previously copied JSON code into the text field. To do this, right-click inside the field\n  and choose the \"Paste\" option, or use the keyboard shortcut (e.g., Ctrl+V or Command+V).\n* After pasting the JSON code, click Save.\n* Review the configuration of the new node to ensure that everything has been copied correctly. Make any necessary\n  adjustments or modifications if needed.\n* Save the changes and exit the advanced configuration mode.\n"}
