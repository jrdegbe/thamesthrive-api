The API allows you to send\ndata from any source, such as a database, a web service, or a file, and have it automatically ingested into the ThamesThrive\nplatform.\n\nThere are 2 way to import data. One via GUI. Find Import in left-hand menu and follow the instructions. Note that\ncurrently only imports from mysql and elastic search are available via gui.\n\nTo import any data into ThamesThrive, you will need to create an API call that sends the data to the ThamesThrive platform. The\nAPI call should include the data you want to import, as well as any additional information that is needed to properly\nprocess the data.\n\nOnce the API call is performed, you can use the ThamesThrive platform to manage the data. This includes creating workflows\nto process the data, creating rules to shape the data, and creating segments to target customers.\n\nFor more information look for `/track` API in the documentation.\n"}
