It can provide insights into\nuser behavior and preferences.\n\nExample Usage:\n\nA user visits a product page on an e-commerce website. The Page View event can be triggered to record the user's\ninteraction with the page, including the product details, images, and other related information.\n\n## Expected properties.\n\n!!! Tip\n\n    All properties are optional. If any property is missing it will not be processed and no error will be reported.\n\n| Name     | Expected type   | Example                                            |\n|----------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| category | string          | \"Contact\" |\n\n## Auto indexing\n\nAuto indexing helps to make data easy to find by creating a structure that organizes the data. This structure is made by\ncopying information from the different parts of the data and putting it into a specific format that can be used to\nanalyze and group the data. This is particularly helpful when dealing with unstructured data that needs to be organized\nin order to be useful.\n\nThis table describes which event property will be copied to event traits.\n\n| Event trait       | Event properties   |\n|-------------------|--------------------|\n| hit.page.category | category           | \n\n## Copy event data to profile\n\nData will not be copied to profile.\n\n## JSON example\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"page-print\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"category\": \"Product Details\"\n  }\n}\n```\n"}
