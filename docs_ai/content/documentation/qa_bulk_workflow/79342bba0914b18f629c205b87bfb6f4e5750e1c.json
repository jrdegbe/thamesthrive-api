The configuration is done by filling out a configuration file in JSON\nformat. For the convenience of non-technical users, ThamesThrive provides plain forms that automatically populate the JSON\nconfiguration based on the data entered in the form. This eliminates the need for manual editing of JSON files.", "hash": "79342bba0914b18f629c205b87bfb6f4e5750e1c"}
