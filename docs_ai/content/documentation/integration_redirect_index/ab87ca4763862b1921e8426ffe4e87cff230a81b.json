{"file_name": "docs/integration/redirect/index.md", "questions": ["What is a link bridge?"], "answer": "# Link bridge\nA link bridge is a valuable tool for tracking and associating clicks on links with user profiles. It is commonly used\nwhen sending emails with community invites, promotions, etc. or monitoring email openings. By creating redirected links,\nwe can track user interactions and gather data. For example, we can create a link that redirects to a tiny 1px image.\nWhen that image is displayed, ThamesThrive receives an event indicating the email was opened. Additionally, the redirect\nlink can include the customer's session ID to identify the specific customer.\n\nThe Inbound Traffic/Event Redirects feature allows you to redirect traffic from specific links to a designated URL. When\na user clicks on one of these predefined links, they will be redirected to the defined URL. Simultaneously, ThamesThrive\nwill receive an event containing information about the redirect, along with any predefined event properties you have\nset. This feature helps gather valuable data about user interactions and link activities.\n\nThe process of setting up Inbound Traffic/Event Redirects involves the following steps:\n\n* Define the links that you want to redirect: This could be any link on your website or in an email that you want to\n  redirect to a specific URL.\n\n* Set the target URL: This is the URL that the user will be redirected to when they click on one of the defined links.\n\n* Define the event properties: These are additional pieces of information that you want to send to ThamesThrive along with\n  the event. This could include information such as the type of event, the source of the event, or any other relevant\n  data that you want to track.\n\n* Set up the event tracking in ThamesThrive: This involves configuring ThamesThrive to receive and process the events that will\n  be sent from your Inbound Traffic/Event Redirects setup.\n\nOnce you have completed these steps, your Inbound Traffic/Event Redirects setup will be ready to use. When a user clicks\non one of your defined links, they will be redirected to the target URL and an event will be sent to ThamesThrive, providing\ninformation about the redirect and any event properties that you have defined.\n\n## Redirect links\n\nAll redirect links are in the form of:\n\n```\nhttp://<ThamesThrive-api-url>/redirect/<redirect-id>\n```\n\n* __ThamesThrive-api-url__ the url to ThamesThrive API server\n* __redirect-id__ id of the redirection. Click on any item in __Inbound Traffic/Event redirects___ to see the full url\n  path.\n\n## Redirect links with session\n\nBy default, all redirect links do not contain any user profile. However, it is possible to include a session ID in the\nredirect link when sending a message from ThamesThrive. To do this, use the following format for the extended link:\n\n```\nhttp://<ThamesThrive-api-url>/redirect/<redirect-id>/<session-id>\n```\n\nWhen using this extended link, ThamesThrive will associate the click with the profile that corresponds to the specified\nsession ID.\n\nTo obtain the session ID, use session@id. If you wish to send the redirect link via email, you can use the provided\ntemplate and access the session ID using {{session@id}}.\n"}
