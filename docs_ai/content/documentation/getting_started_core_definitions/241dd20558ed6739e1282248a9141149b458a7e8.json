The input ports of an action are used to receive data from other actions or from external sources, while the output ports are used to send data to other actions or external systems.\n\nAn action is essentially a piece of code that performs a specific task within the ThamesThrive system. The input ports of an action are mapped to the input parameters of a function in the code, while the output ports are mapped to the return values of the function. This allows actions to be chained together in a workflow, with the output of one action being passed as the input to the next.\n\nThamesThrive can be extended by programmers who write custom code and map it to an action, which is then visible as a node in the workflow editor. An action may also be referred to as a node or an action plugin within ThamesThrive.\n\nFor more information about actions, see the [More on actions](../flow/actions/index.md) documentation.\n\n## Profile\n\nA profile is a detailed record or representation of an individual or entity, typically including information about their characteristics, interests, and activities. A profile can be used to summarize and organize data about a customer in a way that is easy to understand and access.\n\nA profile in the ThamesThrive system is a set of data that represents information about a customer. Profiles can be updated based on incoming events and data from external systems, and they can contain both public and private data.\n\nPrivate data in a profile is typically sensitive information, such as a user's name, email address, age, and total purchases. Public data in a profile may include information such as the segment to which a user belongs, the last time they visited a website, or the number of visits they have made.\n\nThe profile is updated by the workflow, specifically by the actions that are performed within the workflow. The data in a profile can be used for a variety of purposes, such as marketing campaigns and other types of analysis. By updating the profile based on incoming events and data from external systems, it is possible to maintain an up-to-date, comprehensive view of a customer.\n\n## Segment\n\nIn the ThamesThrive system, a segment is a group of customer profiles that have been identified and grouped together based on shared characteristics or behavior. A segment can be defined using a simple logical rule or by more complex artificial intelligence (AI) models.\n\nOnce a segment has been defined, it becomes a part of the customer's profile. A segment defined in the ThamesThrive system can be used in the segmentation workflow, which allows for targeted marketing and other types of personalized experiences or services.\n\nA segment is typically represented by a simple key, such as \"high-volume-customers,\" and is described by a brief summary or description, such as \"Customers with a high volume of purchases.\" This allows for easy identification and understanding of the characteristics or behavior that define a particular segment.\n  \n## Destination - Outbound traffic\n\nIn the ThamesThrive, a destination is an external system where profile data will be sent if it is changed. A destination requires a specific resource, such as an API endpoint or a queue service, in order to receive and process the data.\n\nNot all resources are available as destinations in the ThamesThrive system. For more information about outbound traffic and the available destinations, see the [outbound traffic](../traffic/outbound/index.md) documentation.\n\nIn general, a destination is a place or system to which data is sent or forwarded for further processing or storage. It can be used to transfer data from one system or application to another, allowing for the integration and exchange of information between different platforms or services."}
