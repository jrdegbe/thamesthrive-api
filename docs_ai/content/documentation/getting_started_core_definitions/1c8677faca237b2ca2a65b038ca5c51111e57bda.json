When this point is set, the system will monitor for events that can be used to match the anonymous customer's identified profile.\n\nTo give an analogy, think of an identification point like the ones at an airport or during a police check. You stay anonymous until there is a moment when you need to show your ID. This is an identification point. At this point, you are no longer anonymous. The same goes for ThamesThrive, once you identify yourself, all your past events become part of your identified profile. If identification happens multiple times on different communication channels, all the anonymous actions will become not anonymous anymore.\n\nFor example, if a customer's profile in the system has an email address that matches the email delivered in a new event, then the system can match anonymous customer data with the existing profile and merge all previous interactions/events.\n\nIn simpler terms, identification point is a way for the system to identify customers and keep their information consistent throughout their journey.\n"}
