  "answer": "# Upgrades\nThamesThrive is still in active development, and as such, upgrading to a new version may introduce some compatibility issues. This is due to the way that workflows are persisted, which may change between versions. Workflows created in one version may not work properly with all the available plugins in a newer version, or the plugins may behave differently.\n\nTo ensure a smooth upgrade process, it is recommended to wait until ThamesThrive reaches version 1.0, at which point the code will be fully upgradeable. Until then, you should carefully check for any issues when upgrading to a new version. You can do this by connecting the new version to the old Elastic instance and reviewing any saved workflows or plugin versions for compatibility. If necessary, you can replace old plugins with newer versions to ensure that everything works as expected. Note that it is possible to have multiple versions of the same plugin registered in Elastic.\n\nTo upgrade source to the latest development version pull new docker image.\n\n```\ndocker pull ThamesThrive/ThamesThrive-api:<version>\ndocker pull ThamesThrive/ThamesThrive-gui:<version>\n```\n\nThen you can run it the same way as written in [installation](installation/index.md).\n\n!!! Warning\n\n    Upgrades of minor or development versions of ThamesThrive may cause data loss. Each development version is marked with `-dev` suffix."
