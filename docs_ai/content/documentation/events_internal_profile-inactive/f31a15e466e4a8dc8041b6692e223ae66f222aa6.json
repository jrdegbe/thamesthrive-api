  "answer": "# Event: Profile Inactive\nThis event should be used to indicate that a customer profile has been marked as inactive, meaning that the account is\nno longer active or has been suspended. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as the customer closing their\naccount, failing to meet certain requirements, a violation of terms of service, or defined period of inactivity.\n\nExample usage:\n\n* A customer has failed to meet the requirements of a subscription service and their account has been marked as\n  inactive.\n\n## Expected properties.\n\n!!! Tip\n\n    All properties are optional. If any property is missing it will not be processed and no error will be reported.\n\n| Name   | Expected type   | Example                                              |\n|--------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| reason  | string          | \"Failed to meet subscription requirements\" |\n\n## Auto indexing\n\nData will not be indexed.\n\n## Copy event data to profile\n\nWhen an event occurs, the data associated with it will be automatically duplicated in certain profile properties.
