The process can be\nautomated by following these steps:\n\n1. Set up the Tenant Management Service (TMS): Ensure that the TMS is properly configured and integrated with ThamesThrive.\n\n2. Make an API call to create a new tenant: Use the TMS API to create a new tenant account. This API call will include\n   the necessary information to set up the tenant, such as tenant-specific attributes, installation tokens, and any\n   mappings required for integration with partner systems.\n\n3. Retrieve the generated API key: Once the tenant is created, the TMS API will return an API key. This API key serves\n   as the authentication token for accessing the ThamesThrive API on behalf of the tenant.\n\nBy automating these steps through API calls to the TMS, you can programmatically create new tenants in ThamesThrive.\n", "hash": "bc8a113c012ffe4e3eb1b625318fd263fe5bd97a"}
