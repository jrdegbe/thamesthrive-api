We call them inbound/outbound resources. \nSome resources may be used for [outbound traffic](../traffic/outbound).\n\nInformation about resources is stored in ThamesThrive and can be referenced in Workflow. Workflow actions use them to\naccess external services.\n\n## Credentials\n\nMost of the resources need credentials that are used to connect to the resource. Credentials are attached to resource\nand stored inside ThamesThrive.\n\n!!! Info\n\n    The part of the resource definition that contains sensitive data is encrypted. \n\n### Credentials caching\n\nCredentials are subject to caching. That means that after they are changed you will not see the change immediately but\nafter a certain number of seconds. Usually 60 seconds. Search for `SOURCE_CACHE_TTL` for more information on cache settings.\n"}
