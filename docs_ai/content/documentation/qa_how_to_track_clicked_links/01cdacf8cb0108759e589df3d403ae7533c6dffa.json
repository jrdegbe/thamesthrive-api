The information is stored within the link itself.\n\n* __Parameter Addition__: The second method involves adding a parameter (e.g., __tr_pid) to an existing link. This\n  parameter contains user information. On the destination page, a tracking script generated by the system sends an event\n  to ThamesThrive.\n\nBoth methods are similar, but they differ in who sends the event to the system. In Redirected Links, ThamesThrive handles\nthe event since the link is within the system. In the second method, the script located at the destination address is\nresponsible for sending the event. Pros and Cons\n\nThe first method requires creating artificial links, which can be a bit cumbersome to manage when there are many of\nthem.\n\nThe second method avoids this problem since it uses existing links and only requires appending a parameter, like a\nprofile ID. However, the ThamesThrive system script must be present on the page.\n\nThese two techniques serve different purposes. The first one is useful for tracking if a client has viewed specific\nimages. Since images cannot have a tracking script directly, the first method utilizes artificial links that redirect to\nthe desired image. When the image is downloaded, ThamesThrive automatically sends an event. This is often used to track\nemail openings (email tracking). If an email contains images and they are downloaded, it indicates that the user has\nseen the email.\n\nThe second technique is handy for checking if a user accessed our website from a specific email. By adding parameters\nwith the user's ID or session to the URL, we can track this information.\n\nKeep in mind that if a session number is provided, the event will be attached to the corresponding profile. If only a\nprofile ID is given, a new session will be created for that profile. Read more about this\nmethod [here](../integration/param/index.md)\n\nBoth techniques have a wide range of applications, primarily tracking page transitions, image views, file downloads, and\nmore.\n"}
