ThamesThrive can\nconnect to other systems, such as AI, to analyze, for example, whether a customer who left a product description is\nsatisfied with it or not (sentiment analysis). In this way, the controller decides how the data is processed and whether\nwe need to contact the customer or provide any information in the end user interface."}
