The session ID is a unique identifier generated on the client side (e.g. web browser) and stored in\ncookies. It remains the same for the time the browser is opened. A new session ID is created only when the browser or\napp is closed and reopened.\n\nOn the other hand, the profile ID is a unique identifier for a user profile that is created when the user interacts with\nthe website or app. It is generated by ThamesThrive, and it remains the same throughout the whole user's journey. It is\nstored in local storage of the browser.\n\n!!! Notice\n\n    Each browser/device will have its own profile ID. Profile ID is attached to the browser and can be merged into single \n    profile during identity resolution."}
