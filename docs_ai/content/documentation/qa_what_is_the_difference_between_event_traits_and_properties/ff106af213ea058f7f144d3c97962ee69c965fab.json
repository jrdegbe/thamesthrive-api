Properties have the characteristic of being able to save any data, even if there is a collision in\ndata type. A collision in data types occurs when the data is sent as a number in one instance and as a string in another\ninstance. For example, \"Age\" can be sent as the number 24 or the string \"24 years old.\" Properties are able to store\nthis data even if it is inconsistent or has different data types.\n\nEvent traits, on the other hand, are structured and have data types. Event traits are used for searching, analyzing, and\naggregating events. If the data is inconsistent or has an incorrect data type, such as having \"Age\" as a number but\nreceiving it as a string (\"24 yeas old\"), ThamesThrive will throw an error and not index it. Data in traits have structure and\ntypes, allowing for aggregation, such as calculating the average age based on the \"age\" trait.\n\nTo summarize, if an event includes a property, that property could be copied to a trait so that all events involving\nthis attribute could be identified and aggregated. Copied property gets removed from properties, and it is moved to traits. \nProperties allow for recording and searching, while traits enable analysis and aggregation with structured indexing.\nNot all data must be moved from properties to traits only the one you think you will need to aggregate the events.\n\n---\nThis document answers the following questions:\n- What is event indexing?\n- What is event indexing used for?\n- How can I aggregate data in events?\n- Why I can not aggregate data in events?\n", "hash": "ff106af213ea058f7f144d3c97962ee69c965fab"}
