Tip\n\n    If you want elasticsearch to run in the background, type: \n    `docker run -d -p 9200: 9200 -p 9300: 9300 -e \"discovery.type = single-node\" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.13.2`\n\n## Download the source code\n\nOpen a terminal and go to the directory where you want to keep the code. Enter:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/ThamesThrive/ThamesThrive  #(1)\ngit clone https://github.com/ThamesThrive/ThamesThrive-api #(2)\n```\n\n1. Clones ThamesThrive repository. Code will be available in ThamesThrive folder.\n2. Clones ThamesThrive-api repository\n\n## Create virtual environments\n\nWe need to create 2 virtual environments. Type:\n\n```bash\ncd ThamesThrive-api\npython3.9 -m venv venv  # (1)\ncd ..\ncd ThamesThrive\npython3.9 -m venv venv # (2)\n```\n\n1. Installs virtual environment with python 3.9 for ThamesThrive API\n2. Installs virtual environment with python 3.9 for ThamesThrive library\n\n!!! Tip\n\n    Before creating the virtual environment make sure you have version 3.9.x installed. Type `python --version` to see the python version.\n\n## Install dependencies\n\n=== \"Linux\"\n\n    ```bash\n    # Activates virtual environment (1)\n    cd ThamesThrive-api\n    source venv/bin/activate\n    \n    # Installs dependencies\n    pip install -r app/requirements.txt\n    deactivate \n\n    cd ..\n    \n    cd ThamesThrive\n    source venv/bin/activate\n    \n    # Installs dependencies (2)\n    pip install -r ThamesThrive/requirements.txt\n    deactivate\n    ```\n\n    1. Only ThamesThrive-api is required to run the API. ThamesThrive library will be installed as dependency.\n    2. Installs dependencies of ThamesThrive API.\n\n=== \"Windows\"\n\n    ```bash\n    cd ThamesThrive-api\n    venv\\\\Scripts\\\\activate\n    \n    // Installs dependencies\n    pip install -r app\\\\requirements.txt\n    deactivate\n\n    cd ..\n\n    cd ThamesThrive\n    venv\\\\Scripts\\\\activate\n    \n    // Installs dependencies\n    pip install -r ThamesThrive\\\\requirements.txt\n    deactivate\n\n    ```\n\n=== \"Mac OS\"\n\n    ```bash\n    # Activates virtual environment (1)\n    cd ThamesThrive-api\n    source venv/bin/activate\n    \n    # Installs dependencies\n    pip install -r app/requirements.txt\n    deactivate \n\n    cd ..\n    \n    cd ThamesThrive\n    source venv/bin/activate\n    \n    # Installs dependencies (2)\n    pip install -r ThamesThrive/requirements.txt\n    deactivate\n    ```\n\n    1. Only ThamesThrive-api is required to run the API. ThamesThrive library will be installed as dependency.\n    2. Installs dependencies of ThamesThrive API.\n\n!!! Tip\n\n    Before creating the virtual environment make sure you have version 3.9.x installed. Type `python --version` to \n    see the python version.\n\n!!! Bug \"Trouble shooting\"\n\n    If you see an error that some of the libraries can not be installed, this may mean that you do not have python \n    version 3.9.x installed in your virtual environment.\n\n## Importing project into PyCharm\n\nThe API and ThamesThrive library are installed. Now it is time to open IDE and run it inside code editor. ThamesThrive API\ndepends on ThamesThrive library we will need to reference library inside ThamesThrive API project.\n\n1. Open `PyCharm`\n2. Click `File/Open`\n3. Find and select `ThamesThrive-api` folder\n4. Click open project in `new window`\n5. In the right lower corner next to maser b"}
