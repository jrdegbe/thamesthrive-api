{"file_name": "docs/development/python_env.md", "questions": ["How to run ThamesThrive API inside PyCharm?", "What is the command to run ThamesThrive API in terminal?", "What is the URL to access ThamesThrive GUI?"], "answer": "ranch, select `<no-interpreter>`\n6. Click `add interpreter` and select existing environment\n\nNow it is time to open `ThamesThrive library` and reference it as dependency of `ThamesThrive-api`\n\n1. Open `PyCharm`\n2. Click `File/Open`\n3. Find and select `ThamesThrive` folder\n4. Click open project as `attach`\n\nYou should see something like this in your PyCharm editor.\n\n![Attached project in PyCharm](../images/attached-project.png)\n\n## Running inside PyCharm\n\n1. Find folder `app` in `ThamesThrive-api`\n2. Find file `main.py`\n3. Right click on it and select `Run 'main.py'`\n\nNow the ThamesThrive API is running. You should see the following logs:\n\n```text\nINFO:     Started server process [59653]\nINFO:uvicorn.error:Started server process [59653]\nINFO:     Waiting for application startup.\nINFO:uvicorn.error:Waiting for application startup.\nINFO:     Application startup complete.\nINFO:uvicorn.error:Application startup complete.\nINFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8686 (Press CTRL+C to quit)\nINFO:uvicorn.error:Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8686 (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n```\n\n!!! Bug \"Trouble shooting\"\n\n    If your logs stop on `INFO:uvicorn.error:Waiting for application startup.` that means your elasticsearch \n    docker is not running. Run it and the API will resule after the database is ready.  \n\n!!! Warning \"Running inside PyCharm\"\n\n    Running API inside PyCharm has some pros and cons. Pros are that you can debug the execution of API. Cons are that \n    when you change the code you have to rerun the program. \n    If you want to auto reload the API run in terminal \n    \n    ```bash\n    uvicorn app.main:application --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8686  #(1)\n    ```\n\n    1. Runs ThamesThrive API on port 8686 via uvicorn.\n\n    The above command will run serveral copies (workers) of ThamesThrive API.\n\n!!! Tip\n\n    ```\n    .../elasticsearch/connection/base.py:193: ElasticsearchDeprecationWarning: Elasticsearch built-in security features \n    are not enabled. Without authentication, your cluster could be accessible to anyone. See \n    https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/security-minimal-setup.html to enable security.\n    ```\n\n    This warining may appear when you connect to elasticsearch without credentials set-up. This is not an issue when \n    you run development version of ThamesThrive. \n\n\n## Wrap-up\n\nTesting API can be via `http://localhost:8686/docs`. If you need to test API with GUI console run the following docker \ncommand:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -p 8787:80 -e API_URL=//127.0.0.1:8787 ThamesThrive/ThamesThrive-gui:<version>\n```\n\n!!! Info\n\n    1. Replace `<version>` with current development version, for example: `0.7.3-dev`. If you do not know the current development version \n       please contact us at: __office(at)ThamesThrive.com__ or on any social media: __http://twitter.com/ThamesThrive__, __http://www.youtube.com/@ThamesThrive__,\n       or via __slack__ or __https://github.com/ThamesThrive/ThamesThrive__\n\nGUI will be available at `http://localhost:8787`.\n"}
