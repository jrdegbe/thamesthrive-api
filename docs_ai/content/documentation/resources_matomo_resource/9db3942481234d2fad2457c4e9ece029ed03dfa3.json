Save it somewhere safe as you won\u2019t be able to see it anymore once you leave\nthat screen. For example in a password manager. If you lose it, you will need to generate a new token.\n\nWe recommend you create a new token for every app or purpose. This way, you can easily delete or regenerate the token\nfor specific purposes and see which ones are still being used etc.\n\n## Matomo 3 and older\n\nYou can find the token by logging in Matomo (Piwik), then click on Administration in the top menu, then click the link\n\u201cAPI\u201d in the left menu.\n\nThe token_auth value can be re-generated on request by any user under Administration > Personal Settings."}
