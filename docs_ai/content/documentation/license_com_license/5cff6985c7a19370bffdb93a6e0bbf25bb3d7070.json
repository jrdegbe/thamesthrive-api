However, the license is granted per\nlicensee, so it can't be shared with multiple unrelated customers.\n\nWithin this license, there is no restriction on the amount of data you can store in the system. You can store an\nunlimited number of records, users, and more, as long as they belong to one company. Additionally, the license is not\nlimited by territory, meaning you can use ThamesThrive anywhere globally. You also have the flexibility to replicate the\nsoftware to accommodate your traffic needs.", "hash": "5cff6985c7a19370bffdb93a6e0bbf25bb3d7070"}
