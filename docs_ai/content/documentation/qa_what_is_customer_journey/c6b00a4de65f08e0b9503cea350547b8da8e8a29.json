It involves multiple stages and\ninteractions with a brand. Here is a summary of the steps in the customer journey:\n\n* Awareness: This is the stage where customers become aware of their needs and start searching for solutions. They\n  encounter multiple brands and products during this phase, and it's an opportunity for brands to make a good first\n  impression by providing valuable resources and educational content.\n\n* Consideration: In the consideration stage, customers are actively researching and evaluating different brands and\n  products. They compare features, specifications, and customer support policies. Brands need to focus on promoting\n  their offerings and optimizing the user experience across touchpoints to stand out from competitors.\n\n* Conversion/Purchase: The conversion stage is where customers make a specific action, such as making a purchase,\n  subscribing to a mailing list, or signing up for services. Brands need to convince potential customers that their\n  product is the best solution to their problem. Factors like price, value, customer service, and trustworthiness play a\n  role in the decision-making process.\n\n* Retention: Once a customer has made a purchase, the goal is to retain them and build customer loyalty. This stage\n  involves keeping customers happy and satisfied with the product or service. Providing excellent customer support,\n  optimizing the transaction experience, and offering incentives can help retain customers and encourage them to become\n  repeat buyers.\n\n* Advocacy: The final stage is advocacy, where satisfied customers become brand advocates and recommend the brand and\n  its products or services to others. Word-of-mouth recommendations and positive reviews are powerful in influencing\n  potential customers. Brands can encourage advocacy by engaging with customers, seeking their feedback, and\n  implementing loyalty programs.\n\nUnderstanding the customer journey has several benefits for businesses, including:\n\n1. Improved customer experience: By mapping and analyzing the customer journey, businesses can identify pain points and\n   areas for improvement, leading to a better overall customer experience.\n2. Enhanced customer satisfaction: Meeting customer needs and expectations at each stage of the journey increases\n   customer satisfaction and loyalty.\n3.
