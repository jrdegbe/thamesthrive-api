While there isn't a dedicated CSV import feature, a\nscript can be used to import CSV data through regular ThamesThrive API endpoints. Importing data directly from the machine\nwhere the CSV is saved can often be more advantageous for large datasets, rather than uploading it to the server first.\n"}
