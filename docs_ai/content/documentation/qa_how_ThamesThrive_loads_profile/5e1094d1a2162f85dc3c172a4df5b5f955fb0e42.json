When there is only one profile\nper user, loading is performed through a simple query that matches the ID to the given ID. However, since ThamesThrive\ngathers data from multiple sources and channels, passing the product ID to each of them may not always be feasible.\nHence, during the initial data collection phase when the user is anonymous, multiple profiles belonging to the same user\nare stored in ThamesThrive. When linking profiles, all profile IDs are copied to the `IDS` field, and loading is executed by\nchecking whether the given ID corresponds to any of the IDs stored in the `ids` field. Despite having an `ID` field, the\npossibility of outdated IDs on certain devices necessitates the use of the `ids` field during loading. This approach\nenables ThamesThrive to merge profiles from external systems by simply adding the external system's profile ID to the `ids`\nfield, which can then be used to load the profile.\n\n```json title=\"Example of profile data\"\n{\n  \"id\": \"22082393-4b65-4add-a2e1-7a6982a79d0d\",\n  \"ids\": [\n    \"22082393-4b65-4add-a2e1-7a6982a79d0d\",\n    \"79d07a66-a2e1-4a44-5b65-22082393a2e1\"\n  ],\n  ...\n}\n```\n"}
