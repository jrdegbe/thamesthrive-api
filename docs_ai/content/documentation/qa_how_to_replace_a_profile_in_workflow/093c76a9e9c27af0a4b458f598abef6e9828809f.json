This documentation will walk through how to do this using a workflow and looking for a profile based on a\nspecific identifier, such as an email address. By following the instructions below, you can easily replace a profile and\nensure that the correct information is being used in the workflow.\n\n* Create a workflow with a start and end node\n* Add a \"Load Profile by\" node and connect it to the start node\n* Select the field (e.g., email) that you would like to use to identify the profile\n* Send the email in the event properties\n* Add an \"Event Properties\" node and connect it to the \"Load Profile by\" node for debugging purposes\n* Run the workflow\n* Check the state of the profile to ensure it was successfully loaded\n* If the email is misspelled, there will be an error indicating that no record was found\n* Consider what to do with events that do not have a profile (e.g., discard the event or keep it for further analysis)\n"}
