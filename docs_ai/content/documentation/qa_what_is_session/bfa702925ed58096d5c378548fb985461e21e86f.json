Sessions are important for\nanalyzing user engagement, understanding user journeys, and providing personalized experiences.\n\nWhen a user visits a website or application integrated with ThamesThrive, a session ID is assigned to that user. This\nsession ID is typically stored in a cookie on the user's device, or in memory. The session ID allows ThamesThrive to recognize and\nassociate the user's actions and events within a specific session.\n\nThamesThrive calculates visits based on the continuity of the session ID. If the session ID remains the same, it indicates\nthat the user is still actively engaged with the website or application, and ThamesThrive considers it as part of the same\nvisit. However, if the user closes their browser or the session expires, the session ID is deleted, and a new session\nbegins when the user revisits the site.\n\nBy tracking sessions, ThamesThrive can provide insights into various aspects of user behavior, such as session duration,\npage views per session, entry and exit points, and conversion rates.\n"}
