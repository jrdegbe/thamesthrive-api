The configuration\n  part should be placed first, followed by the script for event sending. Check if the code is properly integrated within\n  the HTML structure of the page.\n\n* __Incorrect API address__: Verify that the API address in your JavaScript code is correct and points to your ThamesThrive\n  server. If the API address is incorrect, the events will be sent to the wrong destination.\n\n* __Incorrect source ID__: Make sure that the source ID specified in the JavaScript code is correct and matches the\n  registered event sources in ThamesThrive. If the source ID is incorrect, ThamesThrive will not recognize the events coming\n  from your JavaScript code.\n\n* __Disabled event source__: Check if the event source specified in your script is enabled in ThamesThrive. If the event source\n  is disabled, the events will not be processed or stored by ThamesThrive.\n\n* __Transitional event source__: If the events are being sent but not saved, it is possible that the event source is set to\n  be transitional. This means that the events are considered ephemeral and are processed without being permanently\n  stored. Review the settings of the event source to determine if this is the case.\n"}
