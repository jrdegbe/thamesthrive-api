This includes event properties, context, profile id, and session id. It is a comprehensive representation of the event that includes all the necessary data to understand the event. Tracker payload is sent to the system collector which collects data.\n\n## Introduction - keeping track of events\n\nSending events is a way of tracking customer behavior in order to better understand and respond to their actions. By capturing and analyzing events, we can gain insights into how customers interact with our systems and products. This information can be used to identify trends, patterns, or opportunities for improvement, and can help us to more effectively support and assist customers, such as during the purchasing process. \n\n## Event example\n\nEvents consist of three main components:\n\n1. The event type: This is a label that identifies the type of event that has occurred. For example, an event type might be \"product purchase\" or \"login attempt\".\n\n2. Event properties: These are the characteristics or attributes of the event that describe the specifics of the event itself. For example, an event that represents a user clicking a button might have properties such as the type of button, the location of the button, and the time at which the event occurred.\n\n3. Context: This refers to data that provides additional context or background information about the event. This data may not be directly related to the event itself, but it can provide valuable insights into the circumstances surrounding the event. For example, if an event represents a customer making a purchase at a store, the event context might include information about the weather conditions at the time of the purchase.\n\n\n## Event registration\n\nTo register an event with ThamesThrive, you will need to send a POST request to the `/track` endpoint on the server where ThamesThrive is installed. \n\n\nYou need to write a code that will connect to the POST method to the url e.g.\nhttp://ThamesThrive.page.com/track and send the data about event plus additional information on the source and session.\n\n```json title=\"Example of track data payload\" linenums=\"1\" hl_lines=\"13-24\"\n{\n  \"source\": {\n    \"id\": \"source-id\"\n  },\n  \"session\": {\n    \"id\": \"session-id\"\n  },\n  \"profile\": {\n    \"id\": \"profile-id\"\n  },\n  \"context\": {},\n  \"properties\": {},\n  \"events\": [ \n    {\n      \"type\": \"purchase-order\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"product\": \"Nike shoes\",\n        \"quantity\": 1\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"page-view\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"options\": { \n    \n  }\n} \n```\n\nThis POST request to the specified URL with the event data and additional information about the source and session. If the request is successful (i.e., the server returns a status code of 200), the code will print a message indicating that the event was registered successfully. If there was an error, it will print the error message returned by the server.\n\nNote that not all data is required. Below you can find example with only required data.\n\n```json title=\"Only required payload data\"\n{\n  \"source\": {\n    \"id\": \"source-id\"\n  },\n  \"session\": {\n    \"id\": \"session-id\"\n  },\n  \"events\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"purchase-order\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"product\": \"Nike shoes\",\n        \"quantity\": 1\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"page-view\"\n    }\n  ]\n} \n```\n\nWhen registering an event, we need the following data.\n\n* Data about the event, i.e. `the type of the event` and its `properties`. There may be several events within one query.\n\n* `Source id`. It must match the event source ([inbound traffic](../getting_started/core_definitions.md#traffic)) defined in ThamesThrive.\n  Otherwise the Authorization error wil be returned.\n\n* And the `session id`. The session id is the saved id of the last session. If this is the first visit, you should\n  generate id, preferably using uuid4 and attach it to the payload. Visits are related with"}
