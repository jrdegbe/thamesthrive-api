{"file_name": "docs/events/event_tracking.md", "questions": ["What is the difference between sending a profile-less event with the profile_less parameter and sending it to the endpoint?"], "answer": ". This enables us to track and analyze customer data even when profile information is not available at the time of the event.\n\n## How to send profile-less event\n\nThere are two ways to send profile-less events.\n\nFirst, by adding the profile_less parameter to the POST / track query. In this way\n\n```\nPOST /track?profile_less=true\n```\n\nA profile-less event will not create a profile, but it will create a session. The data sent to the server must include a session ID, which can be either an existing session or a new one generated on the client-side. It is important to note that a profile-less event will not have a profile when it enters the workflow. The profile field will be empty.\n\nAnother way to send a profile-less event is to post it to the endpoint:\n\n```\nPOST /collect/EVENT-TYPE/SOURCE-ID\n```\n\nwhere:\n\n* EVENT-TYPE is the event type, e.g. coupon-received and\n* SOURCE-ID is the event source id.\n\nIn the body of the query, we send an ordinary object in the form of JSON, which will become the properties of this\nevent.\n\n!!! note\n\n    Please note that sending an event in this manner will not create a session. However, it is possible to add a profile and a \n    session during event processing. This allows for the dynamic linking of the profile to the event within the workflow."}
