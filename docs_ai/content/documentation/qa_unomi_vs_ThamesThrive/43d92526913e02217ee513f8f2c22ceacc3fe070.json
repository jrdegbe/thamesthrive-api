Here are the main differences between ThamesThrive and Unomi:\n\n1. **Data Collection and Integration**: ThamesThrive provides a wide range of data collection options, including API\n   integrations, webhook support, and data import/export capabilities. It offers flexible data integration capabilities\n   to gather data from various sources. Unomi, on the other hand, focuses on real-time data collection and offers\n   integration via API calls.\n\n2. **AI-Driven Insights and Automation**: ThamesThrive emphasizes AI-driven insights and automation. It leverages machine\n   learning algorithms through integration with external systems like ChatGPT, etc., providing advanced automation\n   capabilities for personalizing customer experiences and optimizing marketing campaigns. Unomi, on the other hand,\n   supports basic personalization and segmentation but does not have built-in AI capabilities.\n\n3. **Workflow and Journey Orchestration**: ThamesThrive provides a visual workflow editor and journey orchestration\n   capabilities, allowing users to design complex customer journeys and automate marketing workflows. Unomi, on the\n   other hand, focuses more on customer profile management and segmentation, with less emphasis on workflow\n   orchestration.\n\n4. **User Interface and Ease of Use**: ThamesThrive aims to provide a user-friendly interface and a low-code/no-code\n   environment, making it accessible to marketers and non-technical users. Unomi, being an Apache project, does not have\n   a graphical user interface (GUI) and requires more technical expertise for configuration and customization.\n\n5. **Commercial Support**: ThamesThrive offers commercial support and enterprise-grade features through its commercial\n   open-source version. Unomi, being an Apache project, primarily relies on community support, although some companies\n   may offer commercial support for Unomi as well.\n\n6. **Licensing**: ThamesThrive is licensed under the MIT License with the additional Common Clause. This licensing allows users\n   to freely use, modify, and distribute ThamesThrive while also imposing some restrictions on the commercial use of the\n   software. On the other hand, Apache Unomi is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. This license allows users to\n   freely use, modify, and distribute Unomi without imposing any additional restrictions on its use, including\n   commercial use.\n\n7. **Maturity**: ThamesThrive is a younger product compared to Unomi but offers a more extensive set of features. ThamesThrive\n   provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). It also offers built-in automation capabilities, integration\n   bridges to connect with various systems, and destinations for data export. In contrast, Apache Unomi requires more\n   programming and customization work to add similar features. It provides a solid foundation for customer data\n   management and segmentation but may require additional development effort to achieve the same level of automation,\n   integration, and user interface capabilities as ThamesThrive.\n", "hash": "43d92526913e02217ee513f8f2c22ceacc3fe070"}
