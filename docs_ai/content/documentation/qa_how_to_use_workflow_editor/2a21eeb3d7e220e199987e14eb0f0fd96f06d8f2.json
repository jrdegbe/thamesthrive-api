You will see a screen\nwith all the nodes that you can put on the canvas.\n\n__Search for nodes__: On the left side of the screen, you can search for nodes by typing their names, such as \"start node.\"\nThen, you can drag and drop the node onto the canvas.\n\n__Connect nodes__: To connect nodes, select the node you want to connect and drag an edge to the next node. You can\ndouble-click on a node to rename it and configure how it works.\n\n__Configure nodes__: Nodes have forms that you can fill out to configure how they work. For example, the start node may only\naccept a certain event type, such as a page view. You can also see a short description of each node by hovering over it.\n\n__Save the workflow__: After configuring the nodes, save the workflow. You can have multiple start nodes on one canvas to\nprocess different event types.\n\n__Deploy the workflow__: Remember that the workflow is a draft until you click \"deploy.\" Once deployed, the workflow will be\nvisible and functional on production.\n\n__Check node documentation__: Some nodes have additional documentation that you can access by clicking on them. The\ndocumentation may contain information on configuring the node with advanced JSON setup.\n\n__Use ports__: Nodes have input and output ports that you can click on to see additional documentation. You can use these\nports to pass data between nodes.\n\n__Use advanced runtime settings__: You can access advanced runtime settings by double-clicking on a node. This includes\noptions to skip a node, stop the flow on a node, and stop the workflow if a value does not change."}
