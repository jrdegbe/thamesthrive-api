It is typically used to store information that is not\ncritical for the functioning or analysis of the system but may still be relevant for certain operations or processes.\n\nMisc data can include various types of information, such as operational flags, temporary variables, non-critical\nsettings, or any other data that does not require specific grouping, indexing, or structured storage. It provides a\nflexible storage option for data that doesn't fit into predefined schemas or established data models.\n\nWhile misc data may not have a predefined structure or standardized format, it can still be useful for storing transient\nor context-specific information that is needed for specific tasks or operations within an application or system.\n", "hash": "052625d7e3ca832aa3f4425dd29e45b8de22acea"}
