# Move profile from one segment to another

This action enables you to move a profile from one segment to another. When this action is triggered, the profile will
be relocated from its current segment to the specified destination segment.

If the destination segment does not exist, a new segment will be created to accommodate the profile.

It is important to note that in order to save the changes made to the profile during this process, a __profile update__ is
required. This ensures that the profile is updated and reflects the move to the new segment accurately.
