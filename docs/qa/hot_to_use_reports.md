# How can I use reports in ThamesThrive?

There are two ways to use reports in ThamesThrive:

1. Attaching Reports to Workflows: You can attach reports to your workflows in ThamesThrive and download data while the
   workflow is running. This allows you to gather information and make decisions based on the data generated by the
   workflow. To enable this functionality, you need to use a commercial plugin called "Load Report." With this plugin,
   you can define the specific data you want to collect and analyze within your workflows.
2. Downloading Data via ThamesThrive API: Another way to utilize reports in ThamesThrive is by downloading the data from the
   report through the ThamesThrive API. This approach is particularly useful when you need to export the data to an external
   system or integrate it with other tools. By accessing the ThamesThrive API (/report/{id}/run), you can retrieve the
   desired report data and then use it in any way you require within your external system.
