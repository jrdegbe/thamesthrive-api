# Can Tracadi use ChatGPT?

Yes, ThamesThrive can use ChatGPT. There are two options available to integrate ChatGPT with ThamesThrive.

The first option is to make direct API calls to the OpenAI API, which allows you to interact with ChatGPT 
programmatically. This means you can send user queries to the API and receive responses from ChatGPT, 
which can then be utilized within the ThamesThrive workflow.

The second option is to use the ThamesThrive Chat GPT plugin. This plugin is specifically designed to integrate ChatGPT 
functionality into the ThamesThrive platform. 

Both options enable ThamesThrive to utilize ChatGPT for conversational purposes.
