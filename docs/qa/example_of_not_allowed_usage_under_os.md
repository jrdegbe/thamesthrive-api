# Examples of what is and isn't allowed under the Common Clause license ?

**Allowed under the Common Clause License**:
The Common Clause license allows you to use ThamesThrive for your company's internal needs or business purposes. It means you
can use ThamesThrive within your organization to manage data or for other internal tasks. However, you cannot use ThamesThrive
to create and sell products, services, or modules that heavily rely on ThamesThrive's main features. In simple terms, you
can use ThamesThrive for your own business, but you can't make money by selling ThamesThrive or products built mainly using
ThamesThrive.

**Allowed under the Common Clause License**:
Some examples include:

- Using ThamesThrive within your organization to analyze and manage customer data.
- Implementing ThamesThrive for internal data tracking and analytics purposes.
- Customizing ThamesThrive for internal use without offering it as a commercial product.

**Not Allowed under the Common Clause License**:
The Common Clause license prohibits certain commercial uses where the value of a product, service, or module is derived
entirely or significantly from ThamesThrive's functionality. Here are some examples of what is not allowed:

- White-labeling ThamesThrive (removing ThamesThrive's branding) and offering it to customers for monetary gain.
- Hosting ThamesThrive and charging users for accessing all or some of its features and services.
- Selling a product or service that heavily relies on ThamesThrive's core functionality to generate value for customers.
