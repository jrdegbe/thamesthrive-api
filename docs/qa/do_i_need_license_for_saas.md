# Do I need a commercial license to host ThamesThrive as SaaS?

Yes, to host ThamesThrive as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform and offer it to customers for sale, you will require a
commercial license. This license allows you to go beyond in-house use and use ThamesThrive for commercial purposes, such as
offering it as a service to external customers.
